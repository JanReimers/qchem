# GPW (Gaussian And Plane Waves) — Plan & State

**Self-contained orientation for a fresh session.** GPW = Gaussian orbitals on a periodic lattice, with
the electron density collocated on a real-space grid, FFT→G-space Poisson for Hartree, XC on the grid,
integrated back against the Gaussians to form the KS matrix (CP2K / Lippert–Hutter). It is the north-star
that makes ab-initio solids → battery voltage curves possible.

This doc supersedes the GPW sections of `doc/MolecularPP_HarmonizationRound2.md`.

**The doc is split into two major sections: [DONE](#done) (compact timeline + the still-load-bearing
records) and [TODO](#todo--next) (what's left, in priority order), then the durable invariants + pointers.
Full archived narratives live in `doc/GPWHistory.md` — read THIS file to orient; open the history only for
archaeology.**

# DONE

Everything here is committed on `main`; the GPW suites (`GPW_UT`, `GPW_SCF_UT`) are green.  GPW is a **new
evaluator, not a new IBS** — it satisfies the plane-wave concepts and the whole `Ham_PW_DFT` KS stack drives
it verbatim.  **Full per-increment narratives: `doc/GPWHistory.md`** — below is the compact timeline, then the
still-load-bearing records in full (naming, the CP2K recipe, the C+D analytic-rewrite state, and the §0a
runtime close-out incl. the CP2K NaF oracle + convergence findings).

## Compact timeline (details in doc/GPWHistory.md)
- **1E at Γ** (`ab2c6a76`): Bloch lattice sums delegated to the molecular basis via the engine-neutral
  `Molecule::LatticeSum1E` seam (new edge qcLattice_BS→qcMolecule_BS); home cell == finite matrices <1e-12.
- **DFT tier by collocation** (`cc123b3b`,`63fbf70c`): GPW fills the PW `Repulsion3C`/`Overlap3C` tensors →
  the entire PW_Hartree/PW_XC/IrrepCD stack reused; Coulomb factorised through G-space (weight × 4π/G²).
- **First-light periodic SCF** (`dcef8528`,`db314e6a`): `Integrals_Pseudo<dcmplx>` realised (G-space local PP
  — box-independent, PW G=0 convention; KB via qcMesh) → the real `cSCFIterator`; atom-in-box == finite DFT.
- **General-k + multi-k plumbing** (`b2a29249`): `e^{ik·R}` through the stack; one `GPW_IBS` per BZ k with
  weights.  SIPP→SIPP_SR conditioning lesson (ill-conditioning is a BASIS problem); N3/N5 removed (`10ad6e29`).
- **Bulk over-binding root-caused + FIXED == CP2K** (`a4c94ec5`,`95e8f4a8`): the 16 Ha translation-variance
  was the KB bra using the RAW home orbital (fix: the Bloch orbital); the FFT-raster suspicion was a red
  herring.  Γ SR/2a −7.11505 == CP2K −7.11506.
- **Multi-k validated vs CP2K; complex-k FIXED** (`5fe61aeb`,`1980d6ef`,`745d03ff`): Γ-centred 2×2×2 matches
  CP2K grid-for-grid; the first genuinely-complex k exposed two GPW-evaluator bugs (density ket-conj slot;
  KB image phase must be conj) — fixed; shifted 2×2×2 −7.86673 == CP2K default −7.86744.  Also
  `GetTotalCharge` Tr(D Sᵀ)→Tr(D S).
- **NaF convergence campaign — correctness closed** (2026-07-12): auto `densityEcut` (basis-derived floor,
  <0/0/>0 convention), `∫ρ_grid−N` readout (`ReportGridCharge`), trajectory fingerprint, ionic-seed library
  (PW iters 35→17), Kerker ρ-mixing (`FourierMixCD`; Si-exact −8.24758; +DIIS tames the NaF charge-transfer
  limit cycle).  Grid under-resolution was the dominant cause; then real charge-transfer dynamics.
- **Runtime round 1** (`7708d2dc`,`05e44fab`): OverlapMatrix→zgemm 4×; OpenBLAS pinned 1 thread; magnitude
  screening on the 1E lattice sums (~4×, PSD at any enumerated reach).
- **Runtime round 2 = sampling multigrid DEAD END** (`c94269c8`..`38b63d7b`): sampling collocation rings,
  aliases at bulk (2.66 Ha), needs a hard Rcut → pivot to the analytic method.
- **Analytic kernels A/B/cross-cell** (`0d09a6d5`,`068b4e96`,`729b6355`): per-pair exp-tail boxes +
  modulo-wrap, exact adjoint, screened cross-cell offsets, `G_ERI3::apply` matrix-free seam.
- **§0a Si runtime leg** (`9ff982ba`): stream-cache lockout fix + coverage readout + same-D/phase-independent
  memos; Γ 157→31 s, multi-k 475→89 s, bit-consistent; shifted-MP complex-k gate ENABLED == CP2K to 0.2 mHa.
- **§0a NaF leg** (`b0f497c6`): ANALYTIC KB via the `⟨χ|g⟩` Gaussian seam (== mesh to 4.6e-11; the >33-min
  mesh setup wall dead) + fp32 stream tier; NaF end-to-end 2h15m.
- **§0a D-aware radii + CP2K NaF oracle** (`4c71450c`): eps/|coef| kill+shrink with shared-active-set
  integrate (adjoint stays exact); NaF 40m41s; CP2K same-basis oracle **−27.93128** (own q-tag-free basis).
- **§0a NaF convergence findings** (`35789164`): CP2K recipe machinery (no DIIS, E-gate, tuning knobs);
  α=0.025/G0=1 converges Ecut=40 (pinned anchor −27.73); the fine grid's unphysical attractor (E≈−39)
  captures ALL linear mixing → quasi-Newton mixing + XC consistency are the TODO leads.
- **§0b XC-consistency: FALSIFIED by the FD probe** (`f82db70e`): new gate `GPW.XCPotentialConsistencyFD`
  proves H_xc == ∂E_xc/∂D to FD accuracy (h² scaling to 2e-10) in both the smooth and ρ<0-guard regimes —
  the LDA discrete functional was already exactly consistent.  Full record below.
- **§0b′ gated ladder-completion rung + NaF ROOT CAUSE** (`a218c69c`): the top rung (energy-calibration-
  gated; `RelCutoffSafety` seam accessor; order-free `PairLevel`) + the D=S⁻¹ probe pins the NaF 4.9-e
  grid-charge loss on the Rcut=2a ENUMERATION-SCHEME MISMATCH (grid-independent −2.25 e; fp32 + screens
  vindicated at 7e-9/3.4e-7 per unit |D|).
- **BANISH-Rcut** (`bf3d70ad`): "there is no cut in R" — `(Rs,phases)` deleted from the seams, series
  ε-converged per shell pair inside `LatticeSum1E` (`ForImageOffsets`), KB convention simplified to the
  plain phase oracle, `Rcut`/`collRcut` gone from the GPW surface (finite mode = `CellImages` enum).
  Anchors identical, multi-k 123→84 s; NaF scheme mismatch DEAD (iter-1 charge −4.9 e → −2.4e-6 e);
  true conditioning exposed (λ_min=1.03e-6).
- **SR2 basis + instability CLASSIFIED** (`3f77c96e`): `valence_lowq_sr2.bsd` (the spectrum fingered the
  Na p 0.05 triplet; λ_min→1.57e-3, NaF 6× faster) — but the departure spikes SURVIVE: α-independent,
  DIIS-resistant, smooth growing mode from a clean fixed point ≈−27.73 → hypothesis = near-degenerate
  HOMO/LUMO at Γ (giant response).  The OPEN problem; full records below.
- **NaF Γ-instability MECHANISM MEASURED — band-gap instrument** (2026-07-17): new `ReportBandGap` flag
  appends ε_HOMO/ε_LUMO/gap to the verbose SCF line.  Verdict: the fixed-point gap is HEALTHY (~0.35 Ha,
  wide-gap insulator) so the static-degeneracy hypothesis is FALSE; the real mechanism is a giant-response
  DIFFUSE VIRTUAL whose ε_LUMO dives 0.2–0.5 Ha during the charge-transfer slosh, transiently crossing the
  occupied manifold (gap → 1e-4) → aufbau occupies it → +5–7e3 Ha spike (period ~27).  Records in §0b″.
- **NaF Γ-instability CURED (occupation-swap disease) — MOM wired up** (2026-07-17): the crystal's within-irrep
  fill (`TakeElectrons` = energy order) never touched the parked cross-irrep MOM, so MOM was wired into the
  irrep fill: `TOrbitals::TakeElectrons(ne, priority)` + `SCFParams::UseMOM`/`MOMStartIter` (threaded via a new
  `tSCFWaveFunction::SetMOM`) +
  **delayed IMOM** (aufbau for ~10 fills, then capture {F 2s, F 2p} ONCE and hold — running MOM drifts,
  iter-0 IMOM anchors the raw seed → both catastrophic).  NaF Ecut=40 now CONVERGES −27.76 (Δρ 6e-4, 196
  iters, partial-occ 0, diving virtual banished to −45 Ha unoccupied); vs CP2K oracle −27.93 the 0.17 Ha is
  the grid.  One residual iter-19 MIXING spike remains → 0c Pulay.  198/198 green (`SCFParams::UseMOM` off by
  default).
- **§0c SCF-STRATEGY REFACTOR + PULAY DONE** (2026-07-18, full design `doc/SCFStrategyPlan.md`): the SCF
  convergence machinery is now a role-seam framework — density-mixer seam (`tDensityMixer`: Linear/Kerker;
  bit-identical extraction `f4f48431`), loop-driver virtual dispatch replacing the `WantsLineSearch` mode `if`
  (`388b33d3`), and ONE shared paper-faithful `qchem.Math.DIIS` engine serving BOTH Fock-DIIS and density-Pulay
  (`c41f06f9`+`a60a04de`).  **`PulayMixer`** (Kerker-preconditioned density-DIIS, priming via `PulayStart`)
  accelerates NaF Ecut=40 **196→63 iters** to the SAME −27.756.  Flexed via `scfrun` (which grew a molecular
  `--mol` mode + a fixed SCFParams misalignment): Boron 16 / Sc 21 / O2 triplet 13–15 iters; O2-HF-triplet
  display SEGV fixed (`78b8f66a`).
- **DIRECT FINE-GRID NaF FALLS INTO THE −39 BASIN** (2026-07-19, `30d0eb87`; MOM+Pulay, auto Ecut=160, 15m45s):
  "converges" (Δρ 2.9e-5) to E=+54.3 garbage — the Kerker descent goes STRAIGHT into −39, Pulay thrashes on it.
  So the production-grid failure is a DENSITY/GRID-basin problem, NOT occupation/mixing: MOM+Pulay necessary
  but NOT sufficient.  Next-session plan (grid-continuation seeding + basin removal + OpenMP, basin kept as a
  test fixture) recorded in the TODO §0e below.
- **§0e-PP CP2K local-PP split + Q1 grid speedup** (branch `gpw-0e-pp-local-split`: `94544683` split, `83d827b9`
  Q1; 202/202 green).  Local PP split at the `LocalPotential` form-factor level — LONG (softened-Coulomb → folded
  into `PW_Hartree`'s G-space Poisson) + SHORT (poly×Gaussian → external `PW_Pseudo`); `FormFactorLong` primary,
  base provides `FormFactor=Long+Short` (Design A); a matrix-identical ENERGY-RELOCATION refactor (Si Γ −7.11506
  + NaF −27.756 held).  **Q1 — the ~295 s NaF fine-grid `MakeLocalPP` setup wall is the `relCutoffScale`, over-set
  to 6 by the DENSITY SCREEN** (the increment-1 `−280`/`−259` was `OverlapMatrix`'s `screenD` zeroing off-diagonals
  of the FIXED `V_long`, NOT aliasing; unscreened, smooth==stiff to 4e-3 for soft Si).  Default 6→3 = ~2× (Ecut=160
  578 s→128 s @scale 2), all gates green (Si Γ now 31 s); env knobs `GPW_LOCALPP_SCALE`/`GPW_LOCALPP_FULL` for the
  later 2/4 verify.  The ANALYTIC V_local (short BUILT+finite-validated but dormant; long = the Ewald crux) is a
  SEPARATE accuracy upgrade → **TODO §0e-PP** (re-gates to converged CP2K −27.93).

## Naming (`5f609d2f`) — remember these
- `Overlap(f)` = ANY 1-electron `⟨i|f|j⟩` (f may be a potential); `Repulsion` = the 2-electron `1/r12`.
  So the reciprocal-space field→KS-matrix bridge is `Band_FT_IBS::MakeOverlap(f)` / evaluator
  `OverlapMatrix(f)` — **not** `MakePotential`/`PotentialMatrix`. `Make` = uncached.

## THE CP2K METHOD (Quickstep / Lippert–Hutter) — the authoritative GPW recipe (deep-dived from `~/Code/cp2k`)
Read the CP2K source (`src/grid/ref/grid_ref_{collocate,integrate}.c`, `qs_collocate_density.F`,
`qs_integrate_potential_product.F`, `pw_env/gaussian_gridlevels.F`, `task_list_methods.F`, `aobasis/ao_util.F`).
The recipe — every piece fixes a wall we hit:
1. **ANALYTIC collocation, NOT sampling.** Each primitive PRODUCT is ONE Gaussian: `p=z_a+z_b`, centre
   `R_p=(z_a R_a+z_b R_b)/p`, prefactor `exp(−z_a z_b/p·|R_ab|²)`, times a Cartesian polynomial (binomial
   re-expansion about `R_p` — CP2K's `cab_to_cxyz`; **we already have all this in `Ω`/`H2` in `GaussianRF.C`**).
   Evaluated analytically on grid points inside an exp-tail radius — never a sampled pre-summed orbital.
2. **No Gibbs ringing by construction.** The box ends where the poly×Gaussian `< eps_rho_rspace` (a smooth
   tail), so there is no truncation discontinuity. (This is the fix to the hard-`Rcut` ringing.)
3. **Integrate-back = exact adjoint** (same kernel, gather flag flipped): gathers **Hermite moments of V** over
   the same box. Only **V** is sampled (weighted by the analytic Gaussians), never the sharp orbital product —
   which is WHY it stays accurate on a coarse grid where naive sampling aliases.
4. **REL_CUTOFF multigrid, done right.** Each pair → the coarsest level with `cutoff ≥ p·rel_cutoff`
   (`gaussian_gridlevel`); V is transferred to ALL levels up front via FFT (spectral → no ringing). Analytic +
   matched grid → coarsening is accurate (unlike our sampling multigrid). This is the ~10–100× speed.
5. **Periodicity + screening, no hard cutoff.** Density is collocated from the DENSITY MATRIX `P` over
   NEIGHBOUR-LIST pairs `(i, j@cell R)` — a screened image sum (include only where `|⟨χ_i|χ_j^R⟩| > EPS_PGF_ORB`,
   default 1e-5) — with each compact box MODULO-WRAPPED onto the grid. So: a **screened** image sum (no hard
   Rcut → no ringing) PLUS the wrap (an atom at the cell edge tiles automatically). k-points: the grid density
   is always real/cell-periodic; ALL k-dependence lives in `P(R)=Σ_k w_k e^{ikR}` — collocation is k-agnostic.

## GPW ANALYTIC REWRITE COMPLETE -- Increments C + D LANDED, sampling machinery DELETED (2026-07-14)
The analytic collocate/integrate path IS the SCF path; the whole sampling stack is gone.  Si SR/Rcut=2a Gamma
== CP2K to 0.18 mHa; the Gamma anchor runs in ~40 s (warm) / ~2 min (cold).  14/14 GPW+GPW_SCF green.
- **Kernels multigrid + general-k** (`LatticeSum1E::CollocateDensity/IntegratePotential`): level-vector form
  (finest-first `N_L`/`ecut_L`; K=1 = single grid; the old `MakePotentialMatrix{,MG}` sampling faces DELETED,
  interface stays minimal per the Band_FT_IBS lesson).  Bloch phases enter via a `cellphase_t` CALLBACK
  (`e^{ik.R_n}` of the integer cell offset -- the k-convention stays lattice-side; the kernels enumerate offsets
  internally so a pre-built (Rs,phases) pair cannot work).  Phase conventions: density weight `Re[D_ij e^{-ik.R}]`
  (ket-conj), integrate-back `e^{+ik.R}` -- the same +/- pairing as the KB-projector fix.  2x Hermitian fold
  (loop j>=i, double off-diagonal weights -- the (j,i,-R) twin is exact).
- **REL_CUTOFF assignment + level guards.**  Pair -> coarsest level with `ecut_l >= kRelSafety *
  ecut_fine*(a_i+a_j)/(2 a_max)`; **kRelSafety=2 is LOAD-BEARING**: at 1x the charge-calibrated ratio leaves
  ~e^{-2.5} spectral tails per pair at its own cutoff -- fine for charge (1e-5) but Si Gamma sat 5 mHa below
  CP2K until doubled (CP2K's REL_CUTOFF default is ~3x stiffer than the auto floor).  `EnsureLevels` keeps a
  level only if its SPACING resolves the sharpest assignable pair (`h^2 p_max <= 1`, Poisson e^{-2pi^2}) -- this
  replaced a naive min-N floor after a degenerate Ecut=0.375 level came out as a 1x1x1 GRID whose sigma~2.4
  pairs lost percent-level charge (the crystal-gate 28.37-vs-26.56 failure).
- **Wiring (Band_FT_IBS + IrrepCD UNTOUCHED).**  `Repulsion3C/Overlap3CTensor` -> matrix-free
  `G_ERI3::apply=MakeCollocator(coulomb)` (per-level collocate -> FFT -> rho-tilde combined NESTED in G-space,
  Coulomb kernel folded); `OverlapMatrix(Vtilde)` -> per-level spectral restriction of V + analytic
  `IntegratePotential`.  `G_ERI3::weights` (dense tensor) DELETED.
- **Local PP stays FINE-level (every pair): the analytic sibling of the sampling-MG lesson.**  Routing V_loc
  through the ladder gave Si Gamma -10.72 vs -7.115 WITH charge exact -- a coarse-level pair sees V only
  through its level's {G}, and V_loc's mid-G content is a Ha-scale term.  V_H/V_xc (smooth) stay on the ladder.
  Static, so the one fine sweep is not per-iteration.
- **Two latent bugs fixed:** the seam's `Recip().GetCell().MakeReciprocalCell()` double-reciprocal
  RE-ORIENTS a non-cubic (FCC) primitive cell (evaluator now STORES `itsCell`); the box's fractional bounding
  used `reach/minEdge`, UNDER-COVERING a skewed cell by sqrt(3)/sqrt(2) (now exact per-axis `reach*||row(A^-1)||`
  -- this WAS the committed crystal gate's 2.4e-7 residual).
- **Perf: pair-box STREAM CACHE (the analytic PhiOnGrid successor).**  The per-(pair,offset) box streams
  (wrapped idx + value) are pure geometry -- identical across SCF iterations AND k-blocks (phases apply at
  contraction) -- so they are built once per ladder shape and replayed as gathers: Si Gamma SCF 51.5 min ->
  2m15s cold (23x), bit-identical.  Plus: prefactor-SHRUNK per-offset reach (a far cross-cell image costs a
  near-empty box), ellipsoid pre-screen before the exp/poly evals, incremental grid walk (hoists the
  per-point ToCartesian, was 14% of the profile).  perf now works locally (paranoid=1).
- **Anchors re-pinned on the CONSISTENT scheme (all in `GPW_SCF_UT.C`).**  The analytic collocation is ALWAYS
  screened-complete Bloch, so `Rcut=0` 1E matrices would MIX SCHEMES (observed: `Tr(D S_home)=8` while
  `int rho_grid = 16.55` -- the durable-pin violation).  The old fast Rcut=0 anchors are GONE:
  `SiliconGammaConverges` = SR/Rcut=2a/dE=20 == **CP2K -7.11506 to 0.18 mHa (-7.114883, 18 iters)** [the old
  DISABLED CP2K gate, now THE enabled anchor]; `SiliconMultiKPlumbing` = SR/2a 2x1x1 **-7.45137** (real
  dispersion; the "k-blocks==Gamma at Rcut=0" trick is gone); `SiPseudoAtomInBoxMatchesFinite` box grown
  a=11->16 (cross-cell prefactor 2.7e-2 -> 4.6e-4) == finite sipp to 0.023.  Kernel gates re-referenced to
  **Tr(D S^Bloch)** (charge now conserves to 8e-8; the old "3%" was the WRONG home-only reference, latent since
  the cross-cell commit) + a machine-precision multigrid seam-adjoint gate (Tr(D H) == <apply(D),V>).
- **[grid charge] readout through the live SCF: lost = -1.4e-6 e** -- collocation charge-exact in production.

## §0a RUNTIME CLOSE-OUT — COMPLETE (2026-07-15/16).  The full records:

**(0a) Si LEG DONE (2026-07-15) — Γ 157→31 s (5×), multi-k 475→89 s (5.3×), all anchors BIT-consistent;
complex-k REVALIDATED (shifted-MP gate ENABLED).**  The profile OVERTURNED the commit-message attribution:
the 6→14 min suite regression was NOT the AUTO enumeration radius (the analytic kernels enumerate offsets
per-pair internally, Rcut-independent; every O(|Rs|) consumer loop is cheap norms).  ~85% of the multi-k
anchor was the pair-box kernels re-evaluating analytically per iteration — the STREAM-CACHE BUDGET (added in
the same commit) was the regression:
- **EnsureStreams lockout bug**: after the FIRST over-budget pair, `budget=0` un-cached every later pair.
  Fixed to skip-and-continue packing; + a one-line `[stream cache]` coverage readout per build (pairs
  cached/total, pts cached/dropped) — the tuning instrument for NaF.
- **Budget 100M→150M pts** (~1.8 GB): Si SR demand is 104.9M — at 100M its 7 most-DIFFUSE pairs (the biggest
  boxes) re-evaluated every iteration × k-block ≈ the whole regression.  Si now caches 300/300.
- **Same-D collocation memo** (`GPW_Evaluator::CollocMemo`, shared by the Coulomb + overlap tensor closures):
  each iteration collocated the SAME D twice (RefreshRhoGrid + GetRepulsion3C, ~10% each in the profile);
  the second call now replays the level densities.  EXACT-equality keyed on D → bit-identical.
- **Phase-independent integrate-back memo** (`NR_Evaluator::IntegrateMemo`): h_ij(k)=w Σ_n e^{+ik·Rn} B_ij(n)
  with B k-INDEPENDENT — memoized on the EXACT (ladder shape, scale, V_L), so the static local-PP sweep
  (~10% PER k-block) is paid once per geometry and the per-iteration KS fields once per V instead of per k.
  Contraction order == direct evaluation order → bit-identical on hit (field equality is exact per-element;
  NEVER blaze relaxed equal).
- **Complex-k through the analytic kernels: VALIDATED.**  `SR_2x2x2ShiftedMP_vs_CP2K` (8 k-blocks, genuinely
  complex phases) ENABLED as a regression gate at AUTO Rcut: **−7.86724 vs CP2K −7.86744 (0.20 mHa)**, charge 8,
  CONVERGED Δρ=4.5e-8, ~2.5 min (the memos make the 8 k-blocks share the static sweeps).  Γ-centred 2×2×2
  stays disabled (redundant coverage).  196/196 UTMain green.
**(0a) NaF leg (2026-07-15, same day): ANALYTIC KB + fp32 stream tier LANDED — the setup wall is dead;
per-iteration collocation volume is now the whole NaF story.**
- **ANALYTIC KB ASSEMBLY (the big one).**  The measured NaF setup wall was `MakeSeparablePP`'s mesh
  quadrature — `Eval` (the truncated-Bloch orbital sum) over a 358k-point eCut=160 mesh ≈ billions of exp
  calls: the mesh-path run burned **>33 min without finishing setup**.  CP2K never touches a grid here: GTH
  projectors are polynomial×Gaussian, so ⟨χ|β Y_lm⟩ is analytic.  Now ours is too: qcPseudopotential grew the
  OPTIONAL capability face `SeparablePotential_Gaussian::BetaGaussian` (the radial's CLOSED Gaussian form
  Σ_t c_t r^{l+2n_t} e^{−α_t r²}; HGH/GaussianProjector/MultiSpecies implement it), and the molecular seam
  grew `LatticeSum1E::MakeOverlap(Rs, phases, GaussianFunction)` — b_i = Σ_R phases[R]⟨χ_i|g(·−R)⟩ with
  g = {centre, α, Cartesian-monomial terms}: PURE Gaussian language (user pin: the basis interface talks
  integrals-over-functions; no Fourier/potential vocabulary).  GPW expands β·Y_lm → monomial Gaussians
  (`YlmCartesian` pins `Math::SphericalShell` to the mesh path's own `RealYlm` convention numerically;
  `MultiplyR2` folds the r^{2n} powers) and calls the seam per radial term.  Models without the face keep the
  mesh path (contract intact).  **Gate `GPW.AnalyticSeparablePPMatchesMesh`: analytic == mesh to 4.6e-11**
  (SR/AUTO complete enumeration; at an UNDER-enumerated Rcut the two paths truncate differently — the mesh's
  Bloch orbital reaches χ-image×β-image separations up to 2·Rcut, the analytic single sum stops at Rcut — the
  "two schemes" pin again; measured 9.3e-2 for diffuse SIPP at 1.5a, so the gate pins the COMPLETE setting).
  All four SCF anchors byte-stable (the Si mesh KB was already converged; the win is runtime).
- **fp32 STREAM TIER (the coverage lever).**  Stream budgets are now TWO-TIER: fp64 150M pts (bit-identical
  replay; all Si shapes live here → every anchor/kernel gate unchanged) + fp32 700M pts (~5.6 GB; overflow
  pairs store float values instead of falling to on-the-fly; ~6e-8 relative replay noise, invisible at NaF's
  anchor scales; the collocate/integrate ADJOINT stays machine-exact — both directions replay the SAME
  stream).  NaF coverage 16% → 89%.
- **NaF end-to-end (charge 8.0000000000, 60-iter cap): 2h15m, peak RSS 8.2 GB** on the analytic-KB +
  fp32-tier build.  The remaining cost was PER-ITERATION collocate/integrate volume: 850M cached pts
  replayed ~5 sweeps/iter + 314 small pairs (102M pts, first-fit packing victims) on-the-fly each sweep +
  the one-time scale-6 static-PP fine sweep.  CP2K calibration on this box: Si Γ 3.6 s (ours 31 s),
  Si 2×2×2 shifted 32 s (ours 149 s).

**(0a) D-AWARE RADII + FULL PACKING + THE CP2K NaF ORACLE (2026-07-15, later the same day; 198/198 green).**
- **D-aware density-magnitude screening (CP2K's eps/|coef| radii), `kDensityEps=1e-10`.**  What lands on the
  grid is c·χχ (c = fold·Re[D e^{−ik·R}]), so the tolerance a box must honour is eps/|c|:  (a) each cached
  stream stores its max|value| and replay SKIPS a (pair, offset) whole when |c|·maxv < eps (one compare);
  (b) on-the-fly boxes get the CONTINUOUS shrink — eps/|c| threaded into `ForPairBox` (clamped so |c|>1
  never grows past the geometry screen);  (c) `IntegratePotential` gains an OPTIONAL `screenD` (the seam
  already speaks `chmat_t` densities): the SAME |c|·maxv criterion keeps the IDENTICAL active set in both
  directions, so the collocate/integrate ADJOINT stays machine-exact on the shared truncated operator (the
  variationality ledger's property).  GPW passes its `CollocMemo` D (the iteration's own density); screened
  calls bypass the V-keyed B-memo (cheap by construction); the static PP keeps memo + full sweep.  A pure
  magnitude screen (smooth tails, no Gibbs).  Machine gates UNCHANGED (charge 8.5e-8/2.1e-7, adjoint exact,
  analytic-KB 4.6e-11); Si anchors within pins (Γ/shifted identical to print; multi-k −7.45133 vs −7.45134,
  trajectory 14→17 iters — kills drop 1e-10-level terms, not bit-identical by design).
- **fp32 budget 700M→850M**: NaF now caches 528/528 pairs (0 dropped; 76 fp64 + 452 fp32), peak RSS 9.0 GB.
- **NaF re-time: 2h15m → 40m41s (3.3×).**  Setup (stream build + static-PP sweep) is now a large fixed
  share; the D-aware kills are WEAK while the density sloshes (large |D| everywhere) and strengthen as it
  settles — so the next multiplier is convergence itself.
- **CP2K NaF ORACLE (doc/CP2Kresults.md): Etot = −27.93128 Ha** on OUR transcribed low-q SR basis
  (`naf_gpw_sr_diag.inp`: q-tag-free own basis fixes the q1-vs-q9 abort; damped Broyden α=0.2 +
  diagonalization).  CP2K's ENERGY settles to 1e-6 by ~130 iterations while its DENSITY limit-cycles forever
  (RMS 0.03–0.12) — the SAME charge-transfer cycle we see (its OT run never settled E at all, −25.7↔+253):
  the disease is the system+basis (overlap cond ≈ 8e3), not either implementation.  CP2K's grid also leaks
  2.0e-4 e at 320 Ry (our readout's class).  **OUR Kerker(G0=1)+DIIS at relax 0.3 does NOT settle E in 60
  iterations — iteration 60 lands essentially randomly (−24.03, +887.55 across two runs; charge exactly 8
  throughout).**
**(0a) NaF CONVERGENCE increment (2026-07-16): the linear-mixing axis is EXHAUSTED — the production grid
needs QUASI-NEWTON DENSITY MIXING (the one CP2K ingredient we lack).**
> ⚠ SUPERSEDED by §0b′ (same day): this whole sub-block was measured on the CORRUPTED map (Rcut=2a
> scheme mismatch).  The −39 attractor, the −27.73 pin, and the "quasi-Newton is the missing ingredient"
> conclusion are ALL corrupted-map artifacts — see §0b′ for the honest map (mismatch deleted; the real
> blocker is the Γ giant-response instability, TODO §0b″).  Kept for the archaeology only.
- **Recipe machinery landed** (`DISABLED_NaFRocksaltGamma`): `tSCFAcceleratorNull<dcmplx>` (NO DIIS — the
  mid-cycle Fock extrapolations ARE the +900 Ha spikes: they land exactly on the Nproj=8 iterations),
  fixed-α Kerker, exit on the relative-E gate `MinΔE` with `MinΔρ=1e30` (CP2K's density never converges
  either — E-flat is the physical criterion), env tuning knobs `NAF_{ECUT,ALPHA,KERKER_G0,NMAX}`.
- **α scan at Ecut=40** (cheap grid): α=0.2/0.1 → ±75 Ha period-~48 limit cycles that pass THROUGH the fixed
  point; α=0.05 → contained ±1 Ha, not decaying; **α=0.025 → converges** (~−27.75, ±0.04 residual wobble;
  −27.7304 at the pinned 200-iteration endpoint).  G0=1.0 is the sweet spot — BOTH 2.5 and 0.5 destabilize
  (the Kerker screen must match the charge-transfer mode, not smother or under-damp).  The Ecut=40 answer
  sits 0.2 Ha above the 320-Ry oracle — the leaky-grid gap (Ecut=40 loses >5 e⁻ of F's collocated density).
- **The FINE (auto=160) grid grows a second, UNPHYSICAL attractor** at E≈−39 (Exc≈−143, ∫ρ_grid swinging
  5.1↔7.7 vs Tr(DS)=8): the mid-slosh D loads the sharpest F pairs beyond the grid calibration; the XC of
  that spiky/locally-negative ρ feeds back; the state is self-consistent garbage.  It captures plain damped
  Kerker at EVERY α (0.2 → 0.01 all dive in, sliding past −26 on the way).  Damping sets the rate, not the
  destination — a wrong basin needs a different METHOD.  CP2K converges the SAME map with BROYDEN
  (quasi-Newton, 8-step history, α=0.2).
- **Test now pins the CONVERGING regime** (Ecut=40/α=0.025/200 iters → −27.73 ± 5e-2; both bad attractors
  land ~+65 / ~−39, far outside): a true mixing-regression anchor until the production grid converges.

## §0b XC CONSISTENCY — RESOLVED BY FALSIFICATION (2026-07-16).  The full record:
**The fork does NOT exist; the LDA discrete functional is ALREADY exactly consistent.**  The probe is the
new gate `GPW.XCPotentialConsistencyFD`.
**The instrument came first (as this section prescribed) and overturned the premise.**  The probe replicates
the PW_XC chain verbatim at the evaluator seam (collocate → nested {G_L} combine → `RhoOnGrid`; pointwise
v_xc → raster `ForwardFFT` → per-level restriction → analytic `IntegratePotential`) and compares the central
FD `[E_xc(D+h dD)−E_xc(D−h dD)]/2h` against `Re Tr(H_xc dD)` on the FCC-Si crystal (cross-cell pairs + a
real ladder), with a bilinear Hartree control:
- **Positive-density regime: rel err 8.0e-8 (h=1e-3) → 2.0e-10 (h=1e-4) — exact h² scaling, i.e. pure FD
  truncation converging onto the analytic answer.  H_xc IS ∂E_xc/∂D.**  Hartree control 3e-10.
- **Indefinite-D regime (ρ_q<0 over part of the grid — the Kerker-mixed-field case): same h² scaling
  (5e-6 → 3e-8).  The ρ≤0→0 guards are CONSISTENT between E and H** (both SlaterExchange AND
  VWN_Correlation already guard `rho>0.0 ?` — the "only SlaterExchange has the guard" worry was stale).
Why the old fork description was wrong: `PW_XC::GetEnergy` already takes ∫ε_xc·ρ on the fit grid (the
¾-virial survives only as `ExFunctional::GetEpsXc`'s default, EXACT for Dirac; VWN overrides), and the
"band-limited fit" of v_xc is the fine-grid projection onto the fit ball — which is EXACTLY the gradient of
the grid-sum energy w.r.t. the ball-limited ρ̃ the energy itself uses.  One discrete functional, end to end;
`FittedEpsXc` is molecular-path-only and was never on the periodic route.

**Consequences (re-scope):**
- The NaF fine-grid attractor (E≈−39, Exc≈−143) is a **GENUINE basin of the (under-resolved) discretized
  functional**, not a consistency artifact: mid-slosh D loads the sharpest F-F pairs beyond the grid
  calibration → collocated ρ aliases (∫ρ_grid swings 5.1↔7.7 vs Tr(DS)=8, spiky/locally-negative) → E_xc
  is legitimately huge-negative WITHIN the discretization, and since H_xc is its exact gradient, the SCF
  map is self-consistent there.  A variational minimizer (GDM/OT) would find it too — the escape is not
  consistency but (a) never wandering into the basin (quasi-Newton mixing with small steps = what CP2K's
  Broyden does on the same map; grid-continuation seeding = start in the physical basin) and/or (b)
  removing the basin by resolving the sharp pairs (stiffer fine-grid calibration; CP2K leaks only 2e-4 e
  at the same 160 Ha — understand its EPS_RHO/REL_CUTOFF stiffness if (a) is not enough).
- **ρ-FLOOR: already effectively present for LDA** (both functionals zero at ρ≤0, verified consistent by
  probe 2).  An explicit ε-floor remains only as the **GGA prerequisite** (∇ρ/ρ powers diverge at tiny ρ)
  — fold it into the GGA increment together with the `relCutoff` Vxc-grid item (§5).

## §0b′ TOP RUNG + NaF ROOT CAUSE + BANISH-Rcut + SR2 (2026-07-16, one session).  The full records:
**Two separate things came out of this increment: the ladder-completion rung (LANDED, small-but-real energy
fix, decision pending on scope) and the ACTUAL root cause of the NaF grid-charge catastrophe (an
ENUMERATION-SCHEME MISMATCH — not grids, not precision).  The instruments: `GPW.SharpestPairChargeConservation`
+ `GPW.DISABLED_IllConditionedChargeProbe`.**

**(1) The top rung — LANDED (code in tree), measured, scope decision pending.**
`PairLevel`'s requirement `req = kRelSafety·ecut_fine·(αᵢ+αⱼ)/(2α_max)` is unsatisfiable for pairs with
αᵢ+αⱼ > α_max; one rung at `RelCutoffSafety()·ecut_fine` (appended LAST — `ecut_L[0]` STAYS the resolution
reference, selection made order-free; new seam accessor `LatticeSum1E::RelCutoffSafety`) completes the
ladder by construction.  The local-PP path (relCutoffScale=6) keeps the BASE sub-ladder (`itsNBaseLevels`)
— its stiffened rule would flood the doubled grid with mid pairs.  Machine gates (adjoint, FD-consistency,
charge) all carry over.  MEASURED: the rung is an ENERGY-tail fix ONLY —
- CHARGE is rung-INVARIANT (~1e-9 with or without): the G=0 coefficient survives ball truncation by
  construction, and pow2-padded rasters keep box sampling at ~e^{−50}.  (The gate documents this.)
- Si anchors (explicit Ecut=20 = 2.5× their auto floor): moves SUB-mHa (Γ −7.11485→−7.11482, shifted
  −7.86724→−7.86713 — all within existing gates, no re-pin forced), cost 1.6–4× (the global N³ work:
  Γ 29→48 s, shifted 167→430 s, atom-in-box 25→107 s).
- DECIDED (user, 2026-07-16): **GATED on the energy calibration** — the rung is added only when the
  reference grid sits below `RelCutoffSafety()·cutoffFactor·α_max` (every AUTO run gets it; the Si anchors'
  explicit Ecut=20 ≥ 16 skip it and return to baseline speed).  ALSO NOTED: the auto-floor
  `cutoffFactor=4` calibration ("Ecut=40 loses >5 e⁻ of F") is SAMPLING-ERA data (2026-07-12, pre-analytic-
  rewrite) — the analytic path conserves charge at ANY Ecut, so the production Ecut may be recalibratable
  DOWN by an ENERGY criterion (a large runtime lever that also shrinks the rung's cost).

**(2) NaF iteration-1 grid-charge loss ROOT-CAUSED = ENUMERATION-SCHEME MISMATCH (the "two schemes" pin,
violated by the NaF config itself).**  The probe (D=S⁻¹: PSD, Tr(DS)=n EXACT, entries ~1/λ_min — the
loading a mid-slosh SCF produces):
| error source | measured | per-unit-\|D\| |
|---|---|---|
| **Rcut=2a-truncated S vs screened-complete collocation** | **−2.247 e at \|D\|=450, GRID-INDEPENDENT** (identical Ecut=40 vs auto=160, across fp32 tiering) | 5e-3 |
| kScreenEps screening tails | −0.36 e at \|D\|=1.05e6 | 3.4e-7 |
| fp32 stream tier | ~7e-3 e at \|D\|=1.05e6 | 7e-9 |
- The collocation enumerates its cross-cell offsets INTERNALLY to the complete magnitude screen
  (VALENCE_LOWQ_SR α_min=0.0857 → pair reach ≈33 au), while the NaF SCF builds S over `Rcut=2a`=17.5 au —
  S/charge/diagonalization live in the TRUNCATED scheme, ρ̃/Hartree/XC in the COMPLETE one.  Mid-slosh D
  loads the near-null (diffuse) directions where truncated-S is most wrong → the e-scale ∫ρ−Tr(DS) swings
  (iter-1: 4.9 e), a corrupted SCF map, and (plausibly) the −39 basin.  NOT fixable by mixing (0c) or by
  grids (rung) — the map itself is inconsistent.
- At AUTO Rcut the mismatch vanishes (err/|D| ÷15000) BUT the complete-enumeration S is genuinely
  near-singular: **λ_min ~ 1e-6** (|S⁻¹|~1e6).  The 2a truncation was double-dutying as a conditioning
  crutch (the SR .bsd header even says "PD at a MODEST Rcut").  The precision machinery is VINDICATED
  (fp32 + screens hold their calibrations even at million-scale loading).
**→ BANISH-Rcut — THE REFACTOR LANDED SAME DAY (2026-07-16, in-tree; user directive, attempt #4 — this
time with the crutch measured to corrupt the map).  STATUS + measurements:**
- **The `(Rs, phases)` arguments are GONE from `LatticeSum1E`**: the 1E/KB builders take
  `(cellphase_t, UnitCell)` and sum their series to ε internally per shell pair via `ForImageOffsets`
  (the collocation kernels' own exact-threshold screen — 1E and collocation are now ONE scheme by
  construction).  New finite `MakeOverlap(g)` overload for the home-mode KB.  The KB phase convention
  SIMPLIFIED: with internal symmetric enumeration the historical `(−Rs, conj-phase)` artifact reduces to
  the PLAIN phase oracle (m=−n substitution) — validated by `AnalyticSeparablePPMatchesMesh` AND the
  complex-k shifted-MP anchor (−7.86724, bit-identical).
- **`Rcut`/`collRcut` DELETED from `GPW_Evaluator`/`GPW_IBS`/`GPWFactory`** (`itsR/itsPhase/rcutEff` gone;
  the only remaining image list is the INTERNAL ε-derived Eval/mesh-KB set).  The finite mode is now
  `CellImages::HomeCellOnly` (an `enum class` so a stray numeric can never silently select a mode); its 1E
  matrices are the finite molecule's own cached faces, widened — the home-cell gates run in MILLISECONDS.
- **Anchors: Si Γ −7.11485 / 2×1×1 −7.45133 / shifted −7.86724 — IDENTICAL to pre-refactor**; multi-k
  RUNTIME improved 123→84 s (the exact-threshold enumeration is leaner than the old conservative ball).
  14/14 GPW kernel gates green (adjoint, FD-consistency, charge, KB==mesh).
- **NaF AT COMPLETE ENUMERATION (the measurement this was for): the scheme mismatch is DEAD.**
  Iteration-1 diagonalized-density grid charge: **−4.9 e → −2.4e-6 e**.  True conditioning measured:
  λ_min(S)=1.03e-6, cond=6.0e6 — and **Cholesky survives** (the SCF runs).  The IONIC SEED still loses
  1.09 e (seed construction on the near-singular basis hits the |D|-amplified precision floors — one
  iteration only; the diagonalized densities are clean).  Setup share grew (~28 min to iteration 1 at
  auto Ecut: bigger streams + the 5-level ladder) — the 0d OpenMP/setup item.
**The Ecut=40 recipe measurement ON THE HONEST MAP (α=0.025/G0=1, 200 iters) — the verdict:**
- **The map is healthy and has a genuine fixed point ≈ −28.00**: after the seed transient the SCF descends
  SMOOTHLY and monotonically (−27.64→−27.9999 over ~29 iterations, repeatedly), grid charge −3e-3 clean
  throughout (no slosh, no mismatch).  Note −28.00 vs the corrupted-map "anchor" −27.73 and the CP2K
  320-Ry oracle −27.93128 — the old "0.2 Ha leaky-grid gap" attribution was itself a corrupted-map
  artifact; the honest Ecut=40↔oracle comparison awaits actual convergence + the production grid.
- **The ONE remaining disease is the NEAR-NULL OCCUPATION EVENT** — and (user challenge, answered) it is
  NOT the linear algebra: cond=6e6 costs Cholesky ~7 of 16 digits, V=S^{−1/2} amplifies 10³ — all exact
  enough.  The instability is the RAYLEIGH QUOTIENT of the near-null state: ε_null = vᴴFv/vᴴSv is a ratio
  of two near-zeros, sensitive as δε ≤ ‖δF‖/λ_min.  The LEGITIMATE per-iteration Fock update during the
  Kerker descent is ~1e-2 (Δρ≈2e-2) and projects strongly onto v (the null combination is built of the
  same diffuse functions the mixed V_H/v_xc fields move), so the spurious band sweeps up to 1e-2/1e-6 =
  1e4 Ha per iteration; when its trajectory carries it below the Fermi edge, AUFBAU OCCUPIES IT (a
  1/√λ≈10³-amplitude vector enters D) → E=+1e4, [F,D] 0.12→150.  Signature: DETERMINISTIC period ~29
  (six spikes, iters 45/74/103/131/160/185 — trajectory-driven, not noise), discontinuous [F,D] (an
  occupation swap), charge CLEAN throughout.  This is the classic QC near-linear-dependence collapse —
  molecular codes drop S-eigenvalues below 1e-6..1e-8 for exactly this reason; the criterion that matters
  is ‖δF‖/λ vs the gap, not cond(S).  Previously MASKED by the 2a truncation (λ_min 7.5e-4).  The old
  ±75 Ha limit cycles / the −39 attractor / the "+900 DIIS spikes" all belong to the corrupted map; the
  NaF energy pin is SUSPENDED in the test until the near-null fix lands.  (Fix menu: the basis trim /
  rank-reduction below; occupation control (level shift / MOM) would stabilize around the garbage band
  but leaves ε_null polluting the band structure — not the clean fix.  Verification instrument for the
  SR2 session: print the lowest band energies per iteration — the spurious level should dive across the
  Fermi edge one iteration before each spike.)
**SR2 TRIM — DONE same session (`valence_lowq_sr2.bsd`, enum VALENCE_LOWQ_SR2): drop Na p 0.05 + s 0.0857
(the SPECTRUM identified them: SR's three degenerate 1.03e-6 near-null modes = exactly the Na p 0.05
triplet; F kept intact for the anion).  λ_min 1.03e-6 → 1.57e-3 (cond 2715, Cholesky residual 4e-14);
NaF 200 iters 17 min → 3 min (the deleted diffuse shells owned the biggest boxes).  BUT THE SPIKES
SURVIVED — the conditioning/near-null diagnosis is DISPROVED as the mechanism (measurement-driven, round 3):**
- **α-INDEPENDENT**: 10/10/13 spikes at α=0.025/0.0125/0.00625 (period ~27; smooth descent to the SAME
  ≈−27.73 fixed point each cycle, then a SMOOTH climb-away over ~5 iters before the +5e3-scale blowup —
  a growing departure, not a discontinuous occupation swap).  Rules out the plain linear-mixing gain
  story UNLESS the response multiplier is ~1e4 (α·|λ|≫1 even at α=0.006).
- **DIIS (quasi-Newton in Fock space, `NAF_DIIS=1` knob) does NOT fix it** on the honest map — 51
  excursions, no smooth descents, endpoint −27.1±2 with `En>EMax` flapping.  (Its ban was for the
  corrupted map; on the honest map it fails DIFFERENTLY — fighting the same mode.)
- **The surviving hypothesis: a GIANT RESPONSE MODE from a near-degenerate HOMO/LUMO at Γ** — a tiny gap
  makes χ ~ 1/(ε_v−ε_c) huge: explains the α-independence at practical α, the smooth departure, CP2K's
  OWN eternal density limit-cycle on this same system (RMS 0.03–0.12 forever), and DIIS's failure.
  Γ-only NaF in this minimal ionic basis SHOULD be wide-gap — if the measured gap is tiny, that itself
  is the finding (basis? PP? Γ-only folding?).
Side effect of the refactor: the "(Rs,phases)→one cMesh" future note is MOOT for these seams (no weighted
point set crosses the interface — the stronger form of that cleanup); KMesh + quadrature meshes keep it.

## §0b″ NaF Γ-INSTABILITY — mechanism MEASURED + occupation-swap disease CURED by MOM (2026-07-17).  The full record:
**The classified facts (records in DONE §0b′): the honest, conditioned map descends smoothly to its fixed
point and departs via a GROWING mode — α-INDEPENDENT (10/10/13 spikes at α=0.025/0.0125/0.00625, period
~27, smooth climb-away over ~5 iters), NOT conditioning (SR2 λ_min=1.6e-3 shows the same spikes as SR
1.03e-6), NOT DIIS-fixable (`NAF_DIIS=1`: 51 excursions, `En>EMax` flapping).**

**1. BAND-GAP INSTRUMENT — DONE (2026-07-17, `ReportBandGap` flag on the verbose SCF line; extracts
ε_HOMO/ε_LUMO/gap from `wf->GetEnergyLevels()`, flags a partially-occupied frontier).  The hypothesis is
REFINED, not simply confirmed — the mechanism is now directly visualized (Ecut=40/α=0.025, `GPW_SCF_UT`):**
- **The FIXED-POINT gap is HEALTHY: ε_LUMO−ε_HOMO ≈ 0.33–0.37 Ha (~9–10 eV).**  NaF/Γ in this ionic basis
  IS a wide-gap insulator at convergence (the plateaus iters 30–37, 55–66 sit at gap ≈ 0.35).  So the
  *static* near-degenerate-HOMO/LUMO version of the hypothesis is **FALSE**.
- **Each spike is preceded ONE iteration earlier by ε_LUMO DIVING 0.2–0.5 Ha** — a diffuse virtual with a
  GIANT RESPONSE to the low-G charge-transfer slosh.  The gap collapses (iter 12 → 2.8e-2, ε_LUMO crashing
  +0.167 → −0.077; iter 68 → 1.2e-4 with ε_H/ε_L DEGENERATE) as the virtual crosses the occupied manifold;
  then AUFBAU fractionally occupies it (`[partial-occ HOMO]` fires exactly on the spike iters 14, 41) → a
  ~1/√λ diffuse vector enters D → E=+5e3…+7e3 Ha, [F,D] 0.09 → 130.  Deterministic period ~27 (spikes
  14/41/68 in one run) — matches the classified fingerprint exactly.
- **→ mechanism = a giant-response DIFFUSE VIRTUAL causing a periodic aufbau LEVEL-CROSSING, NOT a small
  static gap.**  (The "χ ~ 1/(ε_v−ε_c)" framing was close but the small denominator is TRANSIENT — created
  by the slosh, not intrinsic; the transition density onto the diffuse virtual is what makes the response
  giant.)  Also explains CP2K's eternal density limit-cycle (RMS 0.03–0.12) on this same system.
- **FRONTIER-WINDOW refinement (2-occ/4-virt window per iteration) — two sharper facts:**
  - **it is ONE ISOLATED hyper-responsive virtual, not a wide-band cluster.**  At the dive (iter 11→12)
    the LUMO crashes +0.167 → −0.077 (0.24 Ha in ONE step) while its virtual NEIGHBOURS (+0.42, +0.79)
    barely move, and at the plateau the LUMO sits ~0.25 Ha clear of the next virtual.  So the giant
    response is a *single* diffuse (Na-3s-like) conduction state that overlaps the charge-transfer region
    — NOT an over-complete diffuse-band cluster.  This argues **3b (physical-but-responsive), not 3a
    (basis ghost)** — and de-prioritises the §1 rank-reduction angle for this instability.
  - **the spike IS an OCCUPATION SWAP — this CORRECTS the §0b′ "growing mode, not a swap" note.**  At each
    spike the F 2p level drops from (6.0) to (4.0) electrons: the diving virtual captures 2 e out of the
    F 2p manifold (iters 14, 41).  The smooth dive (the "growing mode") TERMINATES in the aufbau swap —
    they are two phases of ONE event, not alternatives.  → **MOM (pin the {F 2s, F 2p} occupied subspace)
    is the direct fix**, and should be clean because it is an isolated single-state swap.

**2. MOM FIX — WIRED UP + VALIDATED (2026-07-17; `SCFParams::UseMOM`/`MOMStartIter`).**
- **NOT Fermi smearing / not the "gap≈0" branch** — the fixed-point gap is large, so there is no static
  degeneracy to smear; smearing would leave a residual fractional-occupation error at a wide-gap insulator.
- **The measured mechanism is a clean, isolated, single-state OCCUPATION SWAP (F 2p 6 e → 4 e)** — exactly
  what MOM prevents.  The parked MOM machinery (`tIrrepWF::MOMScores`/`CaptureMOMReference`) lived ONLY in
  the molecular cross-irrep aufbau (`tCompositeWF::FillOrbitalsAufbau`), which the crystal never runs (a
  crystal k-block is a fixed-EC single irrep filled by `TakeElectrons` = pure energy order).  So MOM was
  wired into the **within-irrep** fill: new `TOrbitals::TakeElectrons(ne, priority)` (occupy highest-overlap
  first), driven from `tIrrepWF::FillOrbitals`; the per-run knobs `SCFParams::UseMOM`/`MOMStartIter` threaded
  through `tSCFWaveFunction::SetMOM` (+ activation on a captured
  reference, NOT on the accelerator engaging — NaF's Null accelerator never engages).
- **The reference-capture POLICY is the whole game (two wrong variants measured + rejected):**
  RUNNING MOM (re-capture every iteration) DRIFTS — a spike corrupts the reference, MOM then locks a
  +0.74 Ha level occupied while a −50 Ha level stays empty → wrong −24.4.  IMOM-from-iter-0 anchors the RAW
  SEED (mid-transient, shapes still shifting) → catastrophe (+5 Ha occupied, −112 Ha empty).  **DELAYED
  IMOM WINS** (`MOMStartIter`, default 10): plain aufbau for ~10 fills to descend to the physical fixed
  point, THEN capture {F 2s, F 2p} ONCE and hold it fixed.
- **RESULT: NaF Ecut=40 now CONVERGES.**  Occupation swaps VANISH (partial-occ count 0), the diving virtual
  is banished (−45 Ha, UNOCCUPIED), and the SCF descends SMOOTHLY+MONOTONICALLY to **−27.76** (Δρ 6e-4 at
  150 iters; gap 0.50 Ha) — the physical fixed point the spiking run only ever visited transiently.  vs the
  CP2K oracle −27.93128 at 320 Ry, the ~0.17 Ha is the Ecut=40 grid.
- **ONE residual excursion survives (iter ~19) — but partial-occ 0, so it is NOT an occupation swap: a
  density-MIXING transient (the charge-transfer slosh).  → 0c Pulay/Broyden is the next lever** (damp the
  slosh; also accelerate the slow linear-Kerker tail; matches CP2K's Broyden on this map).  MOM and 0c are
  complementary: MOM stops the swap, Broyden stops the slosh.
- Open sub-question (de-prioritised): WHICH diffuse virtual dives?  A single Na-3s-like state, not an
  over-complete cluster — ties loosely to §1 but MOM makes it a spectator, so §1 stays a curiosity here.
3. **0c (Pulay/Broyden mixer face)** on the conditioned map, now the LEAD remaining item (kills the residual
   iter-19 mixing spike + accelerates the tail); its `MixSignals` trust-region signal (∫ρ_grid − Tr(DS))
   stays — now purely a precision/conditioning health meter.  Also probe: the ionic SEED's 1.09-e
   precision-floor loss (may already be gone with SR2's conditioning).

## §0c PULAY/BROYDEN ρ̃-MIXING — the mixer face + shared DIIS engine landed (2026-07-18; design in doc/SCFStrategyPlan.md).  The full record:
> **SUPERSEDED/EXPANDED by `doc/SCFStrategyPlan.md` (2026-07-18)** — the mixer is one seam of a four-role
> ISP model (orbital / occupation / density / loop) with a single shared extrapolator (DIIS≡Pulay, one
> paper-faithful engine on either the F or ρ residual stream) and an occupation seam that extends to Fermi
> smearing.  Read that doc for the design + increment plan; the sketch below is retained for context.

Mixing is today hardwired inside `tSCFIterator::Iterate` (the `KerkerG0>0 ? KerkerUpdate(relax) :
MixIn(1−relax)` branch + the inlined adaptive-α heuristics).  Extract the face and inject the concrete
from the top (SOLID DIP — the existing `tSCFAccelerator<T>*` ctor-injection precedent):
- **Face** `tDensityMixer<T>` (qcChargeDensity — it speaks ChargeDensity and needs FourierMixCD; no new
  lib edges): `double Mix(cd_t& cdInOut, const cd_t& cdFresh, const MixSignals&)` + `Reset()`;
  `MixSignals={E,[F,D]}` so adaptive policies live INSIDE concretes.
- **Concretes**: `NullMixer` (pass-through — what a GDM/OT-driven SCF wants: a minimizer must not fight a
  mixer); `LinearMixer(α₀)` (today's D-mixing + the adaptive-α policy moved in VERBATIM — molecular SCF
  bit-preserved); `KerkerMixer(α,G0)` (today's KerkerUpdate + its periodic-basis validation moved into
  construction); `PulayMixer(α,G0,m)` (NEW: last-m (ρ̃_in, residual) history, small residual-norm LS,
  Kerker-preconditioned update — the VASP/QE/CP2K scheme; Broyden = a sibling behind the same face).
  Null/Linear T-generic; Kerker/Pulay dcmplx/periodic-only.
- **Plumbing**: `cSCFIterator` ctor gains the mixer pointer beside the accelerator; the Calculation facade
  constructs the concrete (options beside AcceleratorOptions); `SCFParams.KerkerG0/StartingRelaxRo` remain
  as facade DEFAULTS (no call-site break) and the iterator stops reading them.
- **Accelerant on top**: grid-continuation seeding (converge Ecut=40 → seed the fine grid — start in the
  right basin).  Gate: the NaF test on the production grid vs the −27.93128 oracle.
Convergence pays twice: fewer iterations AND stronger D-aware kills on a settled density.

# TODO / NEXT

**Orientation (2026-07-19, end of session).**  Everything through §0c is **DONE** — §0 through SR2, §0b″
(band-gap instrument + MOM cure) and §0c (the SCF-strategy refactor: mixer seam, loop-driver, ONE shared DIIS
engine, and Kerker-preconditioned Pulay) now sit as full records in the [DONE](#done) section above; §0c
design in `doc/SCFStrategyPlan.md`.  NaF Ecut=40 converges (MOM+Pulay, 63 iters, −27.756).  **The ONE
remaining NaF problem is the PRODUCTION GRID (§0e below): the direct auto-Ecut=160 run falls into the −39
density/grid basin — MOM+Pulay are necessary but not sufficient, so grid-continuation seeding + basin removal
(+ OpenMP to make iteration bearable) is the next-session critical path.**  Then the runtime follow-ups (0d)
and the standing queue (1)–(5).

## 0e. NaF PRODUCTION GRID — the one remaining NaF problem (NEXT, critical path)

**DIRECT FINE-GRID RUN MEASURED — 2026-07-19 (MOM + Pulay depth6/start35, auto Ecut=160, 45527 G, 15m45s,
NMAX=100): FAILS to the unphysical basin; grid-continuation seeding is now the CRITICAL PATH, not just an
accelerant.**  The run "converges" (Δρ=2.9e-5, 90 iters) but to E=+54.3 (εH=92/εL=139, Eee=+152/Exc=−137 =
the aliased/negative-ρ garbage breakdown).  The trajectory is the smoking gun: the **Kerker priming descent
goes STRAIGHT into the −39 basin** (iters 20→34: −24→−39.85, smooth), then **Pulay engaging on that garbage
state thrashes** (+45/+102/…) to +54.  Verdict: the fine-grid failure is a DENSITY/GRID-basin problem, NOT
occupation (MOM keeps occ sane) and NOT mixing (Pulay only accelerates — it can't escape a basin, and on the
pathological −39 map it destabilises).  MOM+Pulay are necessary but NOT SUFFICIENT for the production grid.
→ NEXT: implement grid-continuation seeding (converge Ecut=40 physical −27.76 → seed the fine grid with THAT
ρ → start in the physical basin, never wander into −39); and/or (b) stiffen the fine-grid calibration to
REMOVE the basin (CP2K leaks only 2e-4 e at 160 Ha — understand its EPS_RHO/REL_CUTOFF stiffness).

**AGREED PLAN for the next session (user, 2026-07-19) — keep the −39 basin as a TEST FIXTURE; both fixes are
TOGGLEABLE options so the default (ionic seed + current grid) still exposes it, and each fix is verified with
the OTHER turned OFF:**
- **Step 0 — OpenMP over the collocate/integrate pairs — DONE (2026-07-19), but the fine-grid win is smaller
  than hoped; the real lever is now the SETUP (0d).**  `PG_Cart_MnD::NR_Evaluator::CollocateDensity`
  (per-thread private ρ accumulators + a `critical` reduce) and `IntegratePotential` (write-independent per
  pair — no reduction) are OpenMP-parallel over the flattened `(i,j)` pair list.  **Opt-in at runtime via the
  env knob `GPW_OMP_THREADS` (>1; default 1 = serial), NOT `OMP_NUM_THREADS`** — because the Si anchors and a
  threaded NaF run share one UTMain binary and cannot be separated by a global harness pin (the same reason as
  the NAF_*/GPW_ILLCOND_ECUT knobs), so no harness pin was needed (serial by default keeps the anchors
  byte-identical; 201/201 UTMain green).  Toolchain: this LLVM install ships no libomp → `-fopenmp=libgomp`
  (which honours the pragmas but does NOT define `_OPENMP`, so the code gates on our own **`QCHEM_OPENMP`**
  macro); no `<omp.h>` (private-buffer + critical pattern).  See [[project_openmp_runtime]].
  - **MEASURED (NaF fine grid, auto Ecut=160, 4 threads):** per-iteration collocate/integrate **~10.4 → ~6.1
    s/iter ≈ 1.7×** — the per-iteration cost is memory-BANDWIDTH-bound (scatter/gather replay over the cached
    streams), so 4 cores only buy ~1.7×.  Threading confirmed engaged (4 workers running simultaneously at
    Ecut=40 via /proc); charge/energy correct under threads.
  - **THE FINE-GRID WALL IS THE SETUP — AND IT IS `MakeLocalPP`, NOT `EnsureStreams`, AND IT DOES NOT
    PARALLELISE (profiled 2026-07-19, SR2 basis; a per-phase `std::chrono` breakdown + a threaded A/B).**  The
    `cSCFIterator` ctor is **~320 s** of the fine-grid run; inside it: overlap-S is instant, the `EnsureStreams`
    stream build is only **~25 s** (129.5M pts for SR2 — the old "~950M / 5-min" figure was a pre-SR2 basis),
    and the remaining **~290 s is `MakeLocalPP`** (the `relCutoffScale=6` static local-PP sweep in the
    iteration-0 Fock, `GPW/Imp/Evaluator.C:484`).  A 0d attempt to OpenMP `EnsureStreams` (parallel per-pair box
    eval + `critical` budget tiering) was implemented, verified byte-identical serial — and then **REVERTED
    because it gave ZERO speedup** (25 s → 25 s at 4 threads).  Same for `MakeLocalPP` through step 0's
    `IntegratePotential` path (ctor 329 s → 318 s = noise).  ROOT CAUSE: both are dominated by a **few
    ultra-diffuse pairs with enormous boxes** (`MakeLocalPP`'s own comment: "an ultra-diffuse pair's box on N=64
    × ~180 offsets stalls the setup for hours") — a **load imbalance** the biggest pair runs alone on one thread,
    so *per-pair* OpenMP cannot help (99 % CPU throughout).
  - **→ the real fine-grid lever is an ALGORITHMIC `MakeLocalPP` fix, not threading.**  Step 0's per-iteration
    ~1.7× stands (committed); the setup is a separate, algorithmic problem.

### 0e-PP. `MakeLocalPP` SETUP WALL — the CP2K local-PP split (analysis 2026-07-19; NEXT implementation)
**Root cause (measured per-pair):** the `relCutoffScale=6` sweep is **1.6e9 grid points / 290 s**, spread over
406 pairs (NOT a few giant ones — no load imbalance), because scale=6 drags the DIFFUSE pairs (e.g. F s
α=0.275, reach ~9 au × ~180 cell images) onto field-resolution grids.  The energy `∫χ²V_loc` is dominated by
the DEEP WELL near the nucleus (erf/r ~ `Zion/r_loc`, width `r_loc`), so resolving it needs `ecut~1/r_loc²`
for **every** contributing pair — and the diffuse pairs DO contribute (measured below).
- **DEAD END 1 — threading:** memory-bandwidth-bound, 290 s → 290 s on 4 threads (per-pair OR intra-pair
  can't help a bandwidth wall).
- **DEAD END 2 — reduced-exponent level rule** (`p_eff = p/(1+2p·r_loc²)`, parameter-free from r_loc+basis):
  FALSIFIED.  Si Γ **over-binds to −7.216** (vs −7.11485) — the diffuse pairs genuinely couple to the well, so
  coarsening them aliases.  And it doesn't even help cost: `p_eff≈p` for diffuse pairs, so the giant-box pairs
  aren't coarsened at all.  (Also measured: a FIXED long-range `scale` can't serve both elements — Si soft
  r_loc=0.44 ok at scale 3, F hard r_loc=0.2 gives NaF −23.6 at scale 3.)  **Conclusion: per-product grid
  integration of V_loc cannot be both correct and cheap by ANY level rule — the well must be sampled per pair.**
- **→ THE FIX = the CP2K split** (the analogue of Ewald's erf/erfc; `r_loc` is our α, fixed by the PP):
  - **LONG-RANGE `−Zion·erf(r/√2 r_loc)/r`** = a Gaussian core charge → fold into the **G-space Poisson**
    (`PW_Hartree`, one electrostatics term).  The deep well is sampled **once per atom** (the core-charge
    collocation), not per orbital pair → no giant boxes; energy `E_een_long = Σ_G ρ̃_elec(G)·V_long(G)`, exact
    and adjoint-consistent with the matrix (stays variational, `E=Tr(D·H)`).  CP2K: `rho_core` passed to
    `pw_poisson_solve` (`qs_ks_methods.F`); split in `qs_core_hamiltonian.F:54`.
  - **SHORT-RANGE `poly×Gaussian`** = compact, CONVERGENT lattice sum (no Ewald) → **analytic** via the
    `LatticeSum1E::MakeOverlap(GaussianFunction)` seam the analytic KB already uses.  No grid, no `scale`.
  - **Deletes the user knob** (the grad-student-first-day goal): the grid is derived from `r_loc` (PP) +
    basis exponents; the fine cutoff is already auto (`4·α_max`).  CP2K still exposes `CUTOFF`+`REL_CUTOFF` as
    user convergence knobs (the rite-of-passage) — this design is MORE automated.
  - **Implementation increments (each gated on Si Γ == −7.11506, then NaF == −27.756, then re-time):**
    (1) `PW_Hartree` owns the `LocalPotential` + structure; total field `V_H[ρ_elec]+V_long(G)`; energies
    `E_hartree=½Tr(D·V_H)` + `E_een_long=Tr(D·V_long)`; the G=0 alignment (`FormFactorG0`) moves with it.
    (2) short-range → analytic Gaussian seam; drop the `MakeLocalPP` grid sweep entirely.  (3) re-time NaF.
    Interface: expose the GTH split on `LocalPotential` (`FormFactorLong/Short`, a core-charge/`r_loc`
    accessor).  Decided (user 2026-07-19): fold into `PW_Hartree` — "cleaner physics, one Poisson solve."
  - **STATUS 2026-07-19 — increment 1 (the split) + Q1 (the grid speedup) are DONE (branch
    `gpw-0e-pp-local-split`; compact record in the [DONE](#done) timeline).**  The split is a `LocalPotential`
    form-factor property (`FormFactorLong` primary + base-provided `FormFactor=Long+Short`); `PW_Pseudo` does the
    SHORT local, `PW_Hartree(fb,st,loc)` folds the LONG `V_long` into its Fock matrix + owns its energy/alignment
    — a matrix-identical ENERGY-RELOCATION refactor (Si Γ −7.11506 + NaF −27.756 held, 202/202).  **Q1 corrected
    the plan:** the ~295 s wall is the `relCutoffScale`, NOT the per-pair sweep — it was over-set to 6 by the
    DENSITY-SCREEN bug (the `−280`/`−259` was `OverlapMatrix`'s `screenD` zeroing off-diagonals of the FIXED
    `V_long`, NOT aliasing; unscreened, smooth==stiff to 4e-3 for soft Si).  Default `relCutoffScale` 6→3 → ~2×
    (Ecut=160: 578 s → 128 s @scale 2), all gates green.  So implementation increment (2) above is RE-SCOPED:
    **the grid knob (Q1) is the perf fix; the analytic seam is a separate ACCURACY upgrade** — it re-gates to
    converged CP2K (band-limiting cancellation: grid short/long each ~0.5 Ha off, cancelling in the smooth full
    V_loc, so analytic-short + grid-long misses the gate by 0.55 — BOTH must go analytic together).
  - **REMAINING TODO — analytic V_local (accuracy upgrade). Branch `gpw-0e-pp-local-split`.**  Both pieces are
    EXISTING `GaussianRF` kernels (no new Boys function): short = `Overlap3C(χ_i,χ_j,g_short)`, long =
    `−Z_ion·Repulsion3C(χ_i,χ_j,g_core)` (the erf-Coulomb IS a normalized Gaussian core charge, exp `1/2r_loc²`).
    SHORT is BUILT + finite-validated but DORMANT (`LocalPotential_Gaussian::ShortRangeGaussian`,
    `LatticeSum1E::MakeLocalGaussian` = the 3-centre `Overlap3C` MATRIX sibling of the 2-centre `MakeOverlap(g)`
    VECTOR, `GPW_Evaluator::MakeLocalPPShort`).  **LONG is the crux:** the `Repulsion3C` lattice sum is
    conditionally convergent (erf→1/r Madelung tail) ⇒ needs a G-space/Ewald neutralizing background, NOT a
    real-space sum.  Both go analytic TOGETHER; the exact total re-gates NaF to converged CP2K −27.93 (a WIN
    over the Ecut=40 grid −27.756).  **DO AFTER the −39 basin fix** — the fine-grid SCF diverges regardless of
    V_local, so the energy can't be verified until it converges; then also use `GPW_LOCALPP_SCALE=2/4` to verify
    grid scale-convergence.
- **Step 1 — grid-continuation seeding (AVOID the basin) — DONE 2026-07-20 (branch `gpw-0e-pp-local-split`,
  uncommitted): the SCF-DYNAMICS half of the production-grid problem is SOLVED; the residual is now cleanly a
  fine-grid XC-accuracy problem (step 2).**  Two pieces landed, both minimal DIP extensions:
  (a) **explicit-density seed** — a new `tSCFIterator` ctor takes a pre-built `tChargeDensity<T>*` seed
  (owned/consumed in Init) instead of a `SeedStrategy` enum; the existing enum ctor now DELEGATES to it (all
  paths bit-identical, 31 molecular + Si Γ/multi-k gates green).  The SR2 orbital basis is identical at both
  Ecut so the coarse converged density transfers with no re-projection; for the iteration-0 Fock the coarse
  rho-tilde (a sparse G-map keyed by ORBITAL-pair offsets, grid-independent) band-limits onto the fine grid
  via `RhoOnGrid`/`MakeOverlap` (missing high-G → 0) — a smooth physical seed.
  (b) **MOM-reference transfer** — `AdoptMOMReference` on `tIrrepWF`/`tCompositeWF`/`tSCFWaveFunction`/
  `tSCFIterator`: copy the CONVERGED coarse WF's occupied C' subspace as the fine run's FIXED MOM reference
  (valid because the analytic Bloch overlap, hence the orthonormal metric, is grid-independent), held from
  iteration 1.  **REQUIRED**: the density seed ALONE converges to a WRONG −23.3 (MOM captured from the
  contaminated iter-1 fill) or +124 (late MOM) — because on the fine grid the giant-response diffuse virtual
  sits at the F-2p frontier even at the physical density (iter-1 `[partial-occ HOMO]`).  With the coarse
  subspace transferred, the fine SCF descends SMOOTHLY+MONOTONICALLY to a stable fixed point, charge conserved
  to 1e-8 (∫ρ_grid=8.0000000000 — the −39/+54 basin is AVOIDED, not removed: it still exists on the fine-grid
  map, we just never enter it), MOM keeping the diffuse virtual (which DIVES to
  −2.15 Ha on the fine grid) UNOCCUPIED.  Gate `GPW_SCF.DISABLED_NaFGridContinuation` (two-stage: coarse
  Ecut=40 −27.7535 → seed fine auto-Ecut=160); A/B knobs `GC_SEED`/`GC_SEED_MOM`.
  **THE RESIDUAL (→ step 2): the fine fixed point is −24.393, ~3.5 Ha ABOVE the oracle −27.93 (and above the
  coarse −27.754).  Term-by-term (SAME density, coarse vs fine) the gap is almost all Exc (−12.19 → −5.09,
  +7.1 Ha)**: the fine grid builds a SHALLOWER KS potential (F 2p −0.29 → +0.08, more diffuse) so ∫ε_xc·ρ ~
  ρ^{4/3} over the sharp F region collapses — a fine-grid XC/potential-accuracy problem, NOT dynamics.  Charge
  is conserved, so it is NOT charge-aliasing; the density is physically occupied, just XC-under-resolved.
- **Step 2 — remove the residual (STIFFEN the grid / analytic V_local), NEXT**: the isolated blocker is the
  fine-grid Exc collapse above (−7.1 Ha) and the shallow potential / spurious −2.15 Ha diffuse virtual.
  Leads: (a) the §0e-PP **analytic V_local** accuracy upgrade (the plan's expected route to converged CP2K
  −27.93); (b) why the fine grid builds a shallower potential than the coarse for the SAME density — CP2K's
  EPS_RHO/REL_CUTOFF stiffness, the `relCutoffScale`=3 Q1 default, and `GPW_LOCALPP_SCALE=2/4` scale-
  convergence; (c) whether ρ dips locally-negative near sharp F (the XC guard zeroing ε_xc there would eat
  the ρ^{4/3} weight even with ∫ρ conserved).  Verify a fix with grid-continuation OFF (ionic seed) →
  the stiffer grid must converge physical from the ionic seed.  **The SCF harness (step 1) is now in place to
  measure step 2 cleanly** (stable fixed point, no basin/spike confounds).

## 0d. Runtime follow-ups (after 0b/0c)
- **OpenMP over the per-iteration collocate/integrate pairs — DONE (step 0 above).**  Memory-bound → ~1.7×.
- **`MakeLocalPP` is the fine-grid SETUP wall (~290 s of a ~320 s ctor) and needs an ALGORITHMIC fix, not
  threading** (profiled 2026-07-19; full record in §0e step 0).  The `relCutoffScale=6` static local-PP sweep
  forces a few ultra-diffuse pairs onto huge fine-grid boxes → a load imbalance that per-pair OpenMP cannot
  touch (measured: no speedup).  Fix leads: (a) smarter sharp-field level assignment so an ultra-diffuse pair
  (whose own spectrum kills the field tail) stays on a deep coarse level — the sweep's own comment argues this;
  (b) intra-pair (over-offset) parallelism for the few giant pairs.  A per-pair-OpenMP `EnsureStreams` build
  (only ~25 s, and also load-imbalanced) was tried and reverted — no benefit.  CP2K's ssmp is threaded on top.

Then the standing queue: **(1) DROP SR** (rank-reduction + auto-tol, below); **(2) low-q multi-species
bases → Si/NaF/CsI**; **(3) CP2K reference library**; **(4) IBZ**; **(5) cleanups**.

## 1. DROP SR — rank-reduction through the periodic stack + auto-tol
The `_SR` basis is a hand-tuned crutch (drop the most-diffuse primitive so the Bloch overlap is cleanly PD).
We PROVED (2026-07-13; record: doc/GPWHistory.md) that the FULL basis + screening + canonical Eigen/SVD ortho with tol in the
~1000× spectral gap gives a clean overlap transform (‖VᴴSV−I‖=6.6e-11) — BUT the SCF is **BLOCKED**: truncation
reduces the working dim (NaF 37→33) and the periodic stack (`Crystal_EC`/`cDM_CD`/collocation) assumes the full
`n` → "Matrix sizes do not match" (`DISABLED_NaFFullBasisEigenTol`). The MOLECULAR path handles rectangular V;
the PERIODIC path does not. So dropping SR = two pieces:
- **(a) Rank-reduction through the periodic stack** — let a truncated ortho (`V` is `n×(n−k)`) flow through
  `Crystal_EC` (band count `n−k`), `cDM_CD` (density still full `n×n` via `C=V·U'`), and the collocation;
  mirror the molecular path's rectangular-V handling. This is the real work and gates (b).
- **(b) The user-friendly automation** (agreed design; resolved-investigation record: doc/GPWHistory.md): **auto-Rcut**
  [**DONE `9714f58d`** — Rcut<0 = AUTOMATIC, radius from the basis, 3-mode convention] via a basis reach scalar (wall B — the lattice enumerates `CellsInSphere(MaxReach+span)`; exponents
  stay behind the molecular-basis wall, k-convention stays lattice-side), removing the `Rcut` param for one ε
  (CP2K `EPS_PGF_ORB`; CP2K sets no user Rcut). **Auto-tol** via `LASolver` GAP DETECTION (pure LA): force-drop
  `d[i]≤0`, scan the low region for the largest consecutive ratio; if `> R_threshold` (default **30**, exposed
  at the Calculation facade) it's a CLEAN gap → cut there, else fall back to the ε-tol + WARN. `orthoTol<0`=auto
  / `=0`=none / `>0`=explicit (mirrors `densityEcut`). **Auto-cut allowed but NEVER silent** — always `cerr` WARN
  (count + gap ratio + clean/ambiguous). Vision: collapse to ~one CP2K-like ε.

Until (a) lands, **SR stays** (dimension-preserving, cleanly PD, no truncation).

---

## 2. Low-q multi-species bases → Si/NaF/CsI cross-validation (PW + GPW + CP2K)

**Valence-basis GENERATOR — DONE** (`qchem.ValenceBasisGen`; full record: doc/GPWHistory.md): pseudo-atom
SCF → even-tempered valence blocks → `BasisSetData/valence_lowq.bsd` (F 8s+6p E=−21.10, Na 5s+2p E=−0.144;
enum `VALENCE_LOWQ`), tests `UnitTests/ValenceBasisGen_UT.C`.  Pinned lessons: validate against the physically
relevant CHARGE STATE (F⁻ for NaF); oracle GS-energy matching is the WRONG objective (N≈8 windows, refine later
from a NaF orbital-coefficient heat-map); keep per-l exponents DISJOINT (the shared-exponent Gaussian94 reader
bug is flagged in `PG_Cart/Imp/IrrepBasisSet.C` — flipping it re-pins every density-fit anchor).  NEXT: Cs/I.

Hand-roll SIPP-style **low-q valence Gaussian bases** for Na/F/Cs/I so GPW (and CP2K) can run NaF + CsI, then
triangulate our two codes against CP2K on Si/NaF/CsI. Unblocks **multi-species GPW** (the battery-oxide path,
[[project_battery_voltage_goal]]) and yields the CP2K runtimes. The CP2K reference library (§2) is the oracle.

**Why blocked today.** Our GTH PPs are low-q — verified in `gth_potentials.json` LDA: **Na q1, F q7, Cs q1,
I q7** (Na/Cs also ship q9 semicore; F/I only q7). CP2K ships only q9 semicore Gaussian bases for Na/Cs and
**no GTH basis for iodine**, so it aborts on the valence mismatch. The fix is a matched low-q Gaussian valence
basis — which **GPW needs anyway** (GPW = Gaussian orbitals), so the work is shared.

**Include PW? YES — it is the basis-INDEPENDENT anchor, nearly free.** Our plane-wave code needs NO Gaussian
basis (orbitals ARE plane waves; only PP + Ecut) and already has NaF −20.3293 (Ecut=6) / CsI −11.3868 (Ecut=4)
[`606a54ff`]. Converging its Ecut gives the complete-basis limit. Three-way triangulation:
- **GPW vs CP2K** (SAME Gaussian basis + PP + functional) → IMPLEMENTATION correctness (the tight gate).
- **GPW vs PW** (Gaussian basis vs complete) → BASIS quality (the gap = Gaussian incompleteness; GPW ≥ PW in
  energy, i.e. less bound, as an incomplete basis under-binds).
- **PW vs CP2K** (both → complete-basis as CP2K's basis grows + cutoffs converge) → cross-code sanity.
PW is the leg that separates "is our GPW code correct" from "is the Gaussian basis good enough."

**Basis recipe (mirror `sipp.bsd`/`sipp_sr.bsd`).** Uncontracted even-tempered valence (one primitive per .bsd
shell, `nprim=1 coeff=1`), + a `_SR` variant dropping the most-diffuse primitive(s) for Bloch conditioning
(the SIPP→SIPP_SR lesson: ill-conditioning is a BASIS problem, [[feedback_scf_accuracy_levels]]). Valence
shells (from the PP q):

| el | q (Zion) | valence | shells | notes |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| Na | 1 | 3s¹ | s (+p polar) | 1 val e⁻ (alkali) |
| F  | 7 | 2s²2p⁵ | s+p | tight 2p → hard atom, higher cutoff |
| Cs | 1 | 6s¹ | s (+p) | heavy, diffuse 6s |
| I  | 7 | 5s²5p⁵ | s+p | **no GTH Gaussian basis anywhere** — first one; soft, big r_loc |

Seed α_max from the GTH `r_loc`, α_min from the valence ⟨r⟩, ratio ~2.5–3 (SIPP s = 2.0/0.7/0.25). New files:
`BasisSetData/{na,f,cs,i}_lowq{,_sr}.bsd` + `BasisSetData` enum entries + the loader map (mirror sipp/sipp_sr).

**NLCC vs semicore — decision point when the TM-oxide (Mn/Ni/Co, battery-track) bases are built.**  Our XC
is valence-only (E_xc[ρ_val], v_xc[ρ_val]) — CORRECT for the GTH-PADE set we ship (`gth_potentials.json`
has NO NLCC/core-charge entries; the core-valence XC linearization is absorbed at PP generation, and CP2K
runs the same PPs the same way, so all oracles are apples-to-apples).  The GTH remedy where linearization
fails (spin-polarized TM cores) is historically SEMICORE promotion (the Na q1→q9 pattern; sharp semicore
density → much higher grid cutoff), the alternative is NLCC-GTH (Willand 2013 style; CP2K supports an NLCC
section).  If NLCC is chosen: the core density is an analytic per-atom Gaussian → ONE more static
collocation onto the same grid (like the local-PP sweep), then ε_xc/v_xc evaluated at ρ_val+ρ_core in BOTH
the energy and the integrate-back field; ∂ρ_core/∂D=0 so H_xc stays the exact gradient and the
`XCPotentialConsistencyFD` gate covers it unchanged.  Forces add the core-motion term (forces increment).

**Validation loop (per element → per compound).**
1. Build the `.bsd` (+ SR variant).
2. Finite pseudo-ATOM cross-check (the `SiPseudoAtomInBoxMatchesFinite` pattern): `Calculation(atom,
   {.basis=…, .pseudopotential=true})` converges, and GPW-in-box == that finite molecular DFT. Converge the
   basis by adding/tightening functions — NOT against Slater/High (different basis, a loose oracle: SIPP Si
   −3.759 vs Slater/High −3.337).
3. Transcribe the `.bsd` → CP2K `BASIS_SET` format (`El NAME`, nset, per-set `n lmin lmax nexp nshell` +
   exponent/coeff — the `UnitTests/CP2K/SIPP-SR-BASIS` pattern) + a CP2K deck (mirror `si_fcc_gpw*.inp`,
   `POTENTIAL GTH-PADE-q{1,7}`).
4. **Compounds:** NaF (rocksalt FCC), CsI (CsCl simple-cubic). Run **PW, GPW, CP2K**. Record Etot + runtime in
   `doc/CP2Kresults.md`; add did-E-move anchors: GPW → `GPW_SCF`, PW → `PlaneWaveDFTUT`.

**Multi-species GPW plumbing (small — the bases are the real work).** `Ham_PW_DFT` already has the multi-
species ctor (`{{"Na",1},{"F",7}}`, PW path `606a54ff`) and it drives GPW verbatim, so GPW multi-species =
thread the species→q map through `RunGPW`/`GPWFactory` in place of the single `element`/`q=4`. Ewald + the G=0
alignment are already per-atom (Zion per species); `MultiSpecies_Local/SeparablePotential` routers exist.
**DONE — multi-species GPW FIRST LIGHT (2026-07-11): NaF rocksalt Γ converges** (multi-species `Ham_PW_DFT`
ctor `{{"Na",1},{"F",7}}` on the generated `valence_lowq` basis, Na 5s2p + F 8s6p): 22 iters, **charge=8
conserved**, Etot=−25.086 (Enn=−14.00 = ionic Madelung, matches PW). Grid-underconverged (`densityEcut=40`,
Rcut=0) so not yet comparable to PW −20.3293. Gate `GPW_SCF.DISABLED_NaFRocksaltGamma` (~140 s: F's tight
40-a.u. exponent forces a fine density grid). Rcut=2a + SR basis (PSD overlap) → Etot=−23.556 (removes ~1.5 Ha
of the Rcut=0 over-binding).

**NaF cross-validation PINS (2026-07-11; full record: doc/GPWHistory.md):** both codes agree the answer FOR
THIS GAUSSIAN BASIS is ≈ −23.6 (CP2K transiently passes −23.64 vs our −23.556); the ~3.3 Ha gap to PW's
complete-basis −20.3293 is Gaussian-basis INCOMPLETENESS (the "GPW vs PW = basis quality" leg).  The SCF
instability root is the near-singular Bloch overlap METRIC (min eig 7.5e-4, cond≈8000 at SR), NOT occupation;
magnitude screening fixes the TRUNCATION artifacts but not intrinsic over-completeness → SR stays until §1.

**Gates / deliverables.** `doc/CP2Kresults.md` rows Si/NaF/CsI × {PW, GPW, CP2K} (Etot + runtime); `GPW_SCF`
NaF/CsI converge (charge, Etot) == CP2K same-basis; the GPW−PW gap documented (basis quality). **Pitfalls:**
iodine is the first GTH Gaussian basis for the element (validate its pseudo-atom carefully); F's tight 2p is
the hardest (needs the highest cutoff, per the PW NaF vs CsI experience — F set the cutoff, not the heavy I).

## 3. CP2K reference library (the oracle for §2) — BUILT; growing it
CP2K's Quickstep **is** the reference GPW implementation (Lippert–Hutter); its per-term breakdown points
straight at a bug (as this session's hand-rolled breakdown did: Een ×15.7 → local PP → the raster).
I can run CP2K directly: `~/Code/cp2k/build/bin/cp2k.ssmp`, decks in `~/Code/cp2k-runs/`.
- **DONE — CP2K 2026.1 built** (serial ssmp, gcc 15.2) at `~/Code/cp2k` (sibling to qchem6, outside the git
  tree). Toolchain: OpenBLAS+FFTW+libxc+libxsmm+DBCSR, no MPI/libint. Build: `tools/toolchain/build_cp2k.sh`
  (CMake, NOT the old arch-file `make`). Run needs `source install/setup` +
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=install/lib`.
- **DONE — FCC-Si Γ reference (SIPP_SR, GTH-PADE-q4, LDA_X+VWN5):** **Etot = −7.11506 Ha, charge 8**,
  converged by `CUTOFF` 80 Ry (≈40 Ha). Breakdown: Core-H (kin+PP) +5.565, Hartree +10.380, XC −2.544;
  PP total −7.548 (local −8.489, nonlocal +0.941); core self-energy −20.516. (CP2K's GPW electrostatic split
  differs from ours — compare the TOTAL + the cleaner sub-terms kin/XC/nonlocal-PP.) **Γ gate — MET** (−7.11506).
  Also Si **2×2×2 = −7.86744 Ha** (`si_fcc_gpw_222.inp`). Results table: **`doc/CP2Kresults.md`**; decks:
  **`UnitTests/CP2K/`**.
- **PP already aligned:** our `src/Pseudopotential/Data/gth_potentials.json` IS the CP2K GTH-PADE database
  (Si GTH-PADE-q4 params match ours exactly — verified). **Basis: same exponents, transcribed to CP2K
  `BASIS_SET` format** (uncontracted → one set per primitive; see `UnitTests/CP2K/SIPP-SR-BASIS`).
- **NaF/CsI:** the hand-rolled low-q bases + decks are now **§1's plan** (was "blocked"; the plan resolves it).
- **Si 2×2×2 cross-checks DONE + validated:** `si_fcc_gpw_222.inp` (shifted MP, **−7.86744** == our GPW after
  the complex-k fix) + `si_fcc_gpw_222_gamma.inp` (Γ-centred, **−7.77846**, matches our GPW −7.7778).

### Parameters to line up (qchem ↔ CP2K) — keep this table current
| quantity | qchem (ours) | CP2K keyword | note / pitfall |
|---|---|---|---|
| method | GPW | `&DFT &QS METHOD GPW` | (CP2K default is GPW) |
| cell | FCC primitive, a=10.26 a.u. | `&CELL` (A/B/C vectors, `BOHR`) | match lattice vectors exactly; `PERIODIC XYZ` |
| atoms | Si (0,0,0),(¼,¼,¼) frac | `&COORD SCALED` | match fractional coords (the corner atom at 0 is the bug trigger — compare it deliberately) |
| pseudopotential | GTH-LDA q4 (Zion=4) | `POTENTIAL GTH-PADE-q4` | same params (ours from CP2K) |
| orbital basis | SIPP_SR (3s3p, uncontracted) | `BASIS_SET` (our exponents, CP2K format) | convert file; keep it uncontracted |
| exchange | Slater/Dirac Xα=2/3 | LIBXC `LDA_X` | equivalent |
| correlation | **VWN5** | LIBXC `LDA_C_VWN` (=VWN5) | **NOT `PADE`** (that's PZ correlation) — must force VWN5 |
| density cutoff | `densityEcut` (Ha) | `&MGRID CUTOFF` (**Ry**) | **1 Ha = 2 Ry**; ours 8–12 Ha = 16–24 Ry is ~10× too low (CP2K default 300–600 Ry) — see TODO 1 |
| multigrid | single grid | `&MGRID NGRIDS`, `REL_CUTOFF` (Ry) | start `NGRIDS 1` to match; align `REL_CUTOFF` later |
| k-points | `MakeKMesh(shift)` (MP; shift=0 Γ-centred, shift=½ classic MP) | `&KPOINTS SCHEME MONKHORST-PACK` | CP2K's MP is SHIFTED (k=±¼ for even N) — use `kShift=½` to match; its Γ-centred list needs `SCHEME GENERAL` (see `si_fcc_gpw_222_gamma.inp`). CP2K prints its k-list (`grep BRILLOUIN`). Complex-k FIXED (`745d03ff`); the shifted gate awaits revalidation through the analytic kernels (§0a). |
| Poisson | G-space periodic | `&POISSON PERIODIC` | |
| spin | closed shell (Si₂, 8 e⁻) | `LSD` off | |
| occupation | integer, no smearing | `&SCF SMEAR OFF` | insulator |
| lattice-sum reach | AUTO (`Rcut<0`: radius from the basis + magnitude screening; `9714f58d`) | `EPS_PGF_ORB` / neighbour lists (auto) | both sides parameter-free now |
| **energy breakdown** | Ekin, Een, Eee, Exc, Enn, Ealign | CP2K: Overlap, Core (kinetic+PP), Hartree, XC, Core-self/Ewald | **term SPLITS differ** — match the TOTAL first, then map sub-terms (kinetic, XC are the cleanest to compare) |

## 4. Symmorphic space groups + auto-IBZ (deferred qcSymmetry track)
Only the POINT-GROUP part matters for k-reduction. Cubic Si (O_h, centrosymmetric) → IBZ = 1/48 of the BZ,
no time-reversal factor. Validate bit-level: reduced-mesh-with-weights == full-mesh (against Step 2). The IBZ
is an *efficiency* layer, not a correctness requirement — hence it comes AFTER a working full-BZ reference.

## 5. Deferred cleanups (do once bulk works — "the working code is the definitive declaration")
- **Rigorous periodic external PP:** `MakeLocalPP`/`MakeSeparablePP` quadrature the HOME-CELL orbitals against
  the cell's OWN atoms (no periodic-image PP) — exact at Γ / large box, an approximation for a dense crystal.
  Sum the PP over lattice images (analogous to Ewald / the PW G-space assembly).
- **DRY the PP field adapters into `qcPseudopotential`:** `RealYlm`/`BetaYlmField` are byte-identical in
  `PP_{Local,NonLocal}.C` (molecular terms) and replicated in the GPW evaluator. Hoist into a public module in
  `qcPseudopotential` (below both libs). Pure refactor; verify `L_PP` + `A_PP` + `GPW_SCF` unchanged.
- **`cMesh` = `Mesh<dcmplx>` (user-directed):** the `(Rs, phases)` pair (a `{R}` + `{e^{ik·R}}` weighted point
  set) and the density/quadrature grids should collapse to a `template<class W=double> class Mesh` — the
  integration algorithm is identical for real/complex weights, only the weight TYPE differs (confirmed vs
  `src/Mesh/Quadrature.C`). Then a `FourierMesh_R` ({R}) and `FourierMesh_k` ({k} + real BZ weights, unifies
  with today's `KMesh`). A cross-cutting refactor (Quadrature.C + bit-identity across ~29 consumers);
  currently marked with `// future: one cMesh` comments.
- **GGA Vxc fit grid (`relCutoff`) — CORRECTNESS for GGA, guarded now (`44bebe88`):** GPW uses ONE absolute
  `densityEcut` grid for both ρ (Hartree) and v_xc, and `GPW_IBS::CreateCD/VxcFitBasisSet` IGNORE `mp.relCutoff`
  (the CP2K REL_CUTOFF the Hamiltonian derives from the functional's `GridCutoffFactor()`; `PlaneWave_IBS` DOES
  honor it, building its Vxc grid at `Ecut*relCutoff`). LDA relCutoff==1 so it's exact — but a GGA's ∇ρ wants a
  DENSER v_xc grid. Fix = build a separate Vxc grid at `densityEcut*relCutoff`, mirroring the PW Vxc line. A
  guard `assert(relCutoff<=1)` now fires loudly on a GGA-on-GPW attempt instead of silently using the LDA grid.
  **PREREQUISITE NOW IN PLACE (2026-07-20): the fit-grid seam is honest.**  Previously `GPW`'s
  `MakeRepulsion3C(c)`/`MakeOverlap3C(c)` (the shared `EPW_Orbital_DFT_IBS` mixin) DROPPED the fit basis `c`
  and rebuilt the tensor from the block's own `itsGrid` — so a denser `CreateVxcFitBasisSet` grid would have
  been SILENTLY IGNORED (the policy factory and the tensor builder were two disconnected sources of truth for
  the density-fit `{G}`, reconciled only by both hard-coding `DensityGrid()`).  Now `GPW_IBS` overrides those
  two seams to build the tensor over the REQUESTED fit basis's grid (`c` IS-A `PW_Grid_Evaluator`;
  `GPW_Evaluator::Repulsion3CTensor(grid)`/`Overlap3CTensor(grid)` + a grid-parameterized `BuildLevels` ladder).
  Bit-identical while the factory wraps `DensityGrid()` (Si Γ −7.11485 / multi-k −7.45133 / adjoint
  machine-exact / all GPW gates green), and the block's own `OverlapMatrix`/`MakeLocalPP` (KS-assembly, not a
  requested table) keep `itsGrid`.  So densifying `CreateVxcFitBasisSet` will now ACTUALLY take effect for the
  collocated ρ̃ — the GGA increment can diverge the CD/Vxc grids without the tensor silently overriding it.
  (PW's own `relCutoff` Vxc path — `PlaneWaveDFT.ItemK_RelCutoffDensifiesAndConvergesVxc` — was left untouched,
  deliberately not lumped into the GPW-scoped fix; audit it separately if the shared mixin is ever unified.)
- **Multi-grids + whole-density collocation — DONE** (the C+D analytic rewrite, see the DONE entry).
- **Common `PW_Evaluator`/`GPW_Evaluator` base:** the shared FFT engine (`PeriodicGridEvaluator`) is already
  factored; a base earns its keep once general-k k-space logic is shared.

# Durable pins / invariants (carry into all GPW work)
- **THERE IS NO CUT — IN THE R DIRECTION (user pin, 2026-07-16).**  Real-space lattice sums are
  ε-CONVERGED SERIES for a FIXED operator: magnitude screening is the ONLY truncation mechanism; a radius
  must never appear as a parameter, member, or concept in any interface — not user-facing, not internal.
  A truncation radius yields a DIFFERENT operator, not "the operator to ε" (measured: the Rcut=2a NaF
  metric lost 2.25 e per mid-slosh loading), AND must never be a conditioning crutch (that job belongs to
  the basis or to rank-reduction).  The G DIRECTION is different in kind: the Ecut ball is a PROJECTION
  onto a finite auxiliary subspace — variational (adjoint-exact), exponentially controlled, systematically
  improvable — i.e. a legitimate resolution dial, not a cut.  End state: ONE knob per direction —
  ε in R (convergence tolerance), Ecut in G (projection resolution).
- **PP-smoothness is GPW's enabler; GAPW is out of scope (first pass).** All-electron cores are too sharp;
  validate with a well-conditioned GTH valence basis, never all-electron.
- **Use well-conditioned bases for SCF.** Ill-conditioning is a BASIS problem, not a solver/code bug (SIPP
  diffuse → SIPP_SR; N3/N5 removed). "LASolver" symptoms are basis conditioning. `N3/N5` no longer exist.
- **GPW is a Coulomb/Hartree STRATEGY orthogonal to the orbital basis** — a third one beside exact-4-centre
  (`Vee`) and density-fitting (`FittedVee`). Same `⟨χ|V_H|χ⟩` out, different internals.
- **Never assume `orbital == fit`.** Any fit/aux basis comes from the orbital basis via `Create{CD,Vxc}
  FitBasisSet(...)` — the factory is the seam even when trivial.
- **Fit quality is measured by grid-convergence of ρ, NEVER by ΔE_total** (the fit is non-variational).
- **Spin-polarized is the native formulation**; unpolarized is the ζ=0 collapse. New periodic terms
  spin-native (`FittedVxcPol`/`FittedVcorrPol`).
- **Regression style:** periodic/GPW energies are "did-E-move" anchors (pin the converged value, no
  `Converged()` guard). Where a real-space-on-lattice quantity must equal its finite counterpart, assert
  bit-consistency (`L_PP`-style) rather than an absolute oracle.
- **Two self-consistent schemes — do NOT mix:** (A) complete-Bloch analytic single-sum matrices (what GPW
  has, correct as Rcut→∞); (B) truncated-Bloch collocation Gram matrices (always PSD). Scheme-B overlap +
  scheme-A analytic kinetic gave `Ekin=−300`. Stay in scheme A at a converged Rcut (overlap PSD there).

### Symmetry comes AFTER a working GPW (independent optimisation layer, does not gate GPW)
Symmorphic space groups → BZ reduction (irreducible wedge) → SALC with plane waves. None of these gate GPW.
