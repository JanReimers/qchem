# GPW (Gaussian And Plane Waves) — Plan & State

**Self-contained orientation for a fresh session.** GPW = Gaussian orbitals on a periodic lattice, with
the electron density collocated on a real-space grid, FFT→G-space Poisson for Hartree, XC on the grid,
integrated back against the Gaussians to form the KS matrix (CP2K / Lippert–Hutter). It is the north-star
that makes ab-initio solids → battery voltage curves possible.

This doc supersedes the GPW sections of `doc/MolecularPP_HarmonizationRound2.md`.

**The doc is split into two major sections: [DONE](#done) (compact timeline + the still-load-bearing
records) and [TODO](#todo--next) (what's left, in priority order), then the durable invariants + pointers.
Full archived narratives live in `doc/GPWHistory.md` — read THIS file to orient; open the history only for
archaeology.**

# DONE

Everything here is committed on `main`; the GPW suites (`GPW_UT`, `GPW_SCF_UT`) are green.  GPW is a **new
evaluator, not a new IBS** — it satisfies the plane-wave concepts and the whole `Ham_PW_DFT` KS stack drives
it verbatim.  **Full per-increment narratives: `doc/GPWHistory.md`** — below is the compact timeline, then the
still-load-bearing records in full (naming, the CP2K recipe, the C+D analytic-rewrite state, and the §0a
runtime close-out incl. the CP2K NaF oracle + convergence findings).

## Compact timeline (details in doc/GPWHistory.md)
- **1E at Γ** (`ab2c6a76`): Bloch lattice sums delegated to the molecular basis via the engine-neutral
  `Molecule::LatticeSum1E` seam (new edge qcLattice_BS→qcMolecule_BS); home cell == finite matrices <1e-12.
- **DFT tier by collocation** (`cc123b3b`,`63fbf70c`): GPW fills the PW `Repulsion3C`/`Overlap3C` tensors →
  the entire PW_Hartree/PW_XC/IrrepCD stack reused; Coulomb factorised through G-space (weight × 4π/G²).
- **First-light periodic SCF** (`dcef8528`,`db314e6a`): `Integrals_Pseudo<dcmplx>` realised (G-space local PP
  — box-independent, PW G=0 convention; KB via qcMesh) → the real `cSCFIterator`; atom-in-box == finite DFT.
- **General-k + multi-k plumbing** (`b2a29249`): `e^{ik·R}` through the stack; one `GPW_IBS` per BZ k with
  weights.  SIPP→SIPP_SR conditioning lesson (ill-conditioning is a BASIS problem); N3/N5 removed (`10ad6e29`).
- **Bulk over-binding root-caused + FIXED == CP2K** (`a4c94ec5`,`95e8f4a8`): the 16 Ha translation-variance
  was the KB bra using the RAW home orbital (fix: the Bloch orbital); the FFT-raster suspicion was a red
  herring.  Γ SR/2a −7.11505 == CP2K −7.11506.
- **Multi-k validated vs CP2K; complex-k FIXED** (`5fe61aeb`,`1980d6ef`,`745d03ff`): Γ-centred 2×2×2 matches
  CP2K grid-for-grid; the first genuinely-complex k exposed two GPW-evaluator bugs (density ket-conj slot;
  KB image phase must be conj) — fixed; shifted 2×2×2 −7.86673 == CP2K default −7.86744.  Also
  `GetTotalCharge` Tr(D Sᵀ)→Tr(D S).
- **NaF convergence campaign — correctness closed** (2026-07-12): auto `densityEcut` (basis-derived floor,
  <0/0/>0 convention), `∫ρ_grid−N` readout (`ReportGridCharge`), trajectory fingerprint, ionic-seed library
  (PW iters 35→17), Kerker ρ-mixing (`FourierMixCD`; Si-exact −8.24758; +DIIS tames the NaF charge-transfer
  limit cycle).  Grid under-resolution was the dominant cause; then real charge-transfer dynamics.
- **Runtime round 1** (`7708d2dc`,`05e44fab`): OverlapMatrix→zgemm 4×; OpenBLAS pinned 1 thread; magnitude
  screening on the 1E lattice sums (~4×, PSD at any enumerated reach).
- **Runtime round 2 = sampling multigrid DEAD END** (`c94269c8`..`38b63d7b`): sampling collocation rings,
  aliases at bulk (2.66 Ha), needs a hard Rcut → pivot to the analytic method.
- **Analytic kernels A/B/cross-cell** (`0d09a6d5`,`068b4e96`,`729b6355`): per-pair exp-tail boxes +
  modulo-wrap, exact adjoint, screened cross-cell offsets, `G_ERI3::apply` matrix-free seam.
- **§0a Si runtime leg** (`9ff982ba`): stream-cache lockout fix + coverage readout + same-D/phase-independent
  memos; Γ 157→31 s, multi-k 475→89 s, bit-consistent; shifted-MP complex-k gate ENABLED == CP2K to 0.2 mHa.
- **§0a NaF leg** (`b0f497c6`): ANALYTIC KB via the `⟨χ|g⟩` Gaussian seam (== mesh to 4.6e-11; the >33-min
  mesh setup wall dead) + fp32 stream tier; NaF end-to-end 2h15m.
- **§0a D-aware radii + CP2K NaF oracle** (`4c71450c`): eps/|coef| kill+shrink with shared-active-set
  integrate (adjoint stays exact); NaF 40m41s; CP2K same-basis oracle **−27.93128** (own q-tag-free basis).
- **§0a NaF convergence findings** (`35789164`): CP2K recipe machinery (no DIIS, E-gate, tuning knobs);
  α=0.025/G0=1 converges Ecut=40 (pinned anchor −27.73); the fine grid's unphysical attractor (E≈−39)
  captures ALL linear mixing → quasi-Newton mixing + XC consistency are the TODO leads.
- **§0b XC-consistency: FALSIFIED by the FD probe** (`f82db70e`): new gate `GPW.XCPotentialConsistencyFD`
  proves H_xc == ∂E_xc/∂D to FD accuracy (h² scaling to 2e-10) in both the smooth and ρ<0-guard regimes —
  the LDA discrete functional was already exactly consistent.  Full record below.
- **§0b′ gated ladder-completion rung + NaF ROOT CAUSE** (`a218c69c`): the top rung (energy-calibration-
  gated; `RelCutoffSafety` seam accessor; order-free `PairLevel`) + the D=S⁻¹ probe pins the NaF 4.9-e
  grid-charge loss on the Rcut=2a ENUMERATION-SCHEME MISMATCH (grid-independent −2.25 e; fp32 + screens
  vindicated at 7e-9/3.4e-7 per unit |D|).
- **BANISH-Rcut** (`bf3d70ad`): "there is no cut in R" — `(Rs,phases)` deleted from the seams, series
  ε-converged per shell pair inside `LatticeSum1E` (`ForImageOffsets`), KB convention simplified to the
  plain phase oracle, `Rcut`/`collRcut` gone from the GPW surface (finite mode = `CellImages` enum).
  Anchors identical, multi-k 123→84 s; NaF scheme mismatch DEAD (iter-1 charge −4.9 e → −2.4e-6 e);
  true conditioning exposed (λ_min=1.03e-6).
- **SR2 basis + instability CLASSIFIED** (`3f77c96e`): `valence_lowq_sr2.bsd` (the spectrum fingered the
  Na p 0.05 triplet; λ_min→1.57e-3, NaF 6× faster) — but the departure spikes SURVIVE: α-independent,
  DIIS-resistant, smooth growing mode from a clean fixed point ≈−27.73 → hypothesis = near-degenerate
  HOMO/LUMO at Γ (giant response).  The OPEN problem; full records below.
- **NaF Γ-instability MECHANISM MEASURED — band-gap instrument** (2026-07-17): new `ReportBandGap` flag
  appends ε_HOMO/ε_LUMO/gap to the verbose SCF line.  Verdict: the fixed-point gap is HEALTHY (~0.35 Ha,
  wide-gap insulator) so the static-degeneracy hypothesis is FALSE; the real mechanism is a giant-response
  DIFFUSE VIRTUAL whose ε_LUMO dives 0.2–0.5 Ha during the charge-transfer slosh, transiently crossing the
  occupied manifold (gap → 1e-4) → aufbau occupies it → +5–7e3 Ha spike (period ~27).  Records in §0b″.
- **NaF Γ-instability CURED (occupation-swap disease) — MOM wired up** (2026-07-17): the crystal's within-irrep
  fill (`TakeElectrons` = energy order) never touched the parked cross-irrep MOM, so MOM was wired into the
  irrep fill: `TOrbitals::TakeElectrons(ne, priority)` + `SCFParams::UseMOM`/`MOMStartIter` (threaded via a new
  `tSCFWaveFunction::SetMOM`) +
  **delayed IMOM** (aufbau for ~10 fills, then capture {F 2s, F 2p} ONCE and hold — running MOM drifts,
  iter-0 IMOM anchors the raw seed → both catastrophic).  NaF Ecut=40 now CONVERGES −27.76 (Δρ 6e-4, 196
  iters, partial-occ 0, diving virtual banished to −45 Ha unoccupied); vs CP2K oracle −27.93 the 0.17 Ha is
  the grid.  One residual iter-19 MIXING spike remains → 0c Pulay.  198/198 green (`SCFParams::UseMOM` off by
  default).
- **§0c SCF-STRATEGY REFACTOR + PULAY DONE** (2026-07-18, full design `doc/SCFStrategyPlan.md`): the SCF
  convergence machinery is now a role-seam framework — density-mixer seam (`tDensityMixer`: Linear/Kerker;
  bit-identical extraction `f4f48431`), loop-driver virtual dispatch replacing the `WantsLineSearch` mode `if`
  (`388b33d3`), and ONE shared paper-faithful `qchem.Math.DIIS` engine serving BOTH Fock-DIIS and density-Pulay
  (`c41f06f9`+`a60a04de`).  **`PulayMixer`** (Kerker-preconditioned density-DIIS, priming via `PulayStart`)
  accelerates NaF Ecut=40 **196→63 iters** to the SAME −27.756.  Flexed via `scfrun` (which grew a molecular
  `--mol` mode + a fixed SCFParams misalignment): Boron 16 / Sc 21 / O2 triplet 13–15 iters; O2-HF-triplet
  display SEGV fixed (`78b8f66a`).
- **DIRECT FINE-GRID NaF FALLS INTO THE −39 BASIN** (2026-07-19, `30d0eb87`; MOM+Pulay, auto Ecut=160, 15m45s):
  "converges" (Δρ 2.9e-5) to E=+54.3 garbage — the Kerker descent goes STRAIGHT into −39, Pulay thrashes on it.
  So the production-grid failure is a DENSITY/GRID-basin problem, NOT occupation/mixing: MOM+Pulay necessary
  but NOT sufficient.  Next-session plan (grid-continuation seeding + basin removal + OpenMP, basin kept as a
  test fixture) recorded in the TODO §0e below.
- **§0e-PP CP2K local-PP split + Q1 grid speedup** (branch `gpw-0e-pp-local-split`: `94544683` split, `83d827b9`
  Q1; 202/202 green).  Local PP split at the `LocalPotential` form-factor level — LONG (softened-Coulomb → folded
  into `PW_Hartree`'s G-space Poisson) + SHORT (poly×Gaussian → external `PW_Pseudo`); `FormFactorLong` primary,
  base provides `FormFactor=Long+Short` (Design A); a matrix-identical ENERGY-RELOCATION refactor (Si Γ −7.11506
  + NaF −27.756 held).  **Q1 — the ~295 s NaF fine-grid `MakeLocalPP` setup wall is the `relCutoffScale`, over-set
  to 6 by the DENSITY SCREEN** (the increment-1 `−280`/`−259` was `OverlapMatrix`'s `screenD` zeroing off-diagonals
  of the FIXED `V_long`, NOT aliasing; unscreened, smooth==stiff to 4e-3 for soft Si).  Default 6→3 = ~2× (Ecut=160
  578 s→128 s @scale 2), all gates green (Si Γ now 31 s); env knobs `GPW_LOCALPP_SCALE`/`GPW_LOCALPP_FULL` for the
  later 2/4 verify.  The ANALYTIC V_local (short BUILT+finite-validated but dormant; long = the Ewald crux) is a
  SEPARATE accuracy upgrade → **TODO §0e-PP** (re-gates to converged CP2K −27.93).
- **§0e step 1 (grid-continuation) + step 2 (XC-collapse ROOT-CAUSED & FIXED)** (2026-07-20, branch
  `gpw-0e-pp-local-split`; commits `75e1d4c8`,`758b92a8`,`c816cb39`,`10a91a1e`,`1e13df74`,`4e84284c`,`b65e4185`,
  `a7769f81`; Si Γ −7.11485 bit-identical, adjoint machine-exact, 28 PW anchors green).
  **Step 1 — grid-continuation seeding**: explicit-density seed ctor (`tSCFIterator`, enum ctor delegates) +
  `AdoptMOMReference` (transfer the converged coarse WF's occupied subspace as the fine MOM reference — the
  density seed ALONE gave a wrong −23.3).  Avoids (not removes) the −39 basin.
  **Step 2 — the fine-grid Exc collapse (NaF pinned −24.4 vs oracle −27.93) ROOT-CAUSED**: F's tight density
  (product α≈80) UNDER-RESOLVED on the fit grid → the collocated ρ aliases into huge negative lobes (`negCharge
  −9.3 e`, `neg-frac 0.50` even at the converged fixed point; Si clean at 0.08 %) → the XC `ρ>0` guard's
  grid-sensitive interaction collapses Exc.  **FIXED** by (a) the **fit-grid thread-through** (`MakeRepulsion3C`/
  `MakeOverlap3C` build the tensor over the REQUESTED fit basis's grid, not the block's own), (b) the
  **`Overlap3C` ADJOINT** (`G_ERI3::applyAdjoint` + `ContractAdjointG_ERI3`: the KS matrix `⟨i|v|j⟩=Σ_k
  v-tilde(G_k)⟨i|e^{iG_k}|j⟩` is the BACKWARD contraction of the same tensor, carrying the fit grid — killing the
  grid-less `MakeOverlap(field)` that silently used the coarse grid), and (c) **density-fit densification** =
  making `cutoffFactor` big enough to resolve the product (**4→8**; measured F: `negCharge −9.3→−0.03 e`, clean
  SCF −26.198).  **ONE-GRID cleanup**: `itsGrid`→`itsFFT_R_G_Grids`, `GPW_CDFIT_SCALE`+second grid deleted,
  `CreateCD/VxcFitBasisSet` self-documenting (`{G}_ρ`=`DensityGrid()`, `{G}_vxc`=relCutoff·`{G}_ρ`).  Bugs fixed
  en route: `CollocMemo` grid-collision segfault (`c816cb39`), `RhoOnGrid` out-of-band aliasing guard (`10a91a1e`).
  **HONEST PICTURE**: the old −27.75 was an ALIASING COINCIDENCE; the resolved answer is −26.198, the gap to the
  oracle now the still-coarse **local-PP** base grid, NOT the density.  REMAINING → **TODO §0e step 2** (the
  grid-matched CP2K validation + the grid/exponent diagnostics; the local-PP resolution).

- **Grid instruments + grid-matched CP2K validation → GPW VALIDATED** (`aecbb410`,`a6560e3e`): run-start
  grid diagnostic (`ReportGrids`) + match knobs (`GPW_MGRID_ECUTS`/`GPW_RELCUTOFF`); CP2K restored via
  conda-forge; the 4.26 Ha "gap" decomposed = 0.76 MOM-pinned excited state + 3.50 REAL SR↔SR2 basis
  physics (ball/Gibbs hypothesis falsified by the 480-Ha probe); **NaF SR2 == CP2K to 0.45→0.19 mHa**;
  `doc/GPWGrids.md` = the grid inventory.  Full records: §0e★/§0f below.
- **§0e-PP (a)+(b): absolute κ rule + ANALYTIC short V_loc in production** (`5d963b04`): req=κ·(αᵢ+αⱼ)
  (CP2K `gaussian_gridlevel`; e^{−κ/2} pair tails, κ=30) replaces `relCutoffScale`; analytic 3-centre
  short (the periodic G=0 double-count caught by the new gate); Si Γ grid-vs-analytic identical to 5
  decimals.  Gate `GPW.LocalPPKappaSelfConverged`.
- **MIXED-RADIX RASTERS** (`1837b21e`,`aaaf1ea0`): PocketFFT submodule behind `qchem.FFT` (pow2 →
  radix-2 verbatim = bit-identical) + `FFTGrid()` pads to 5-SMOOTH N: 199/199 with ZERO re-pins,
  **NaF verification 94 min → 190 s (30×) at 0.4 µHa** (fine raster 128³→72³); CP2K gap 900×→33×.
  OpenMP pair-loops (`GPW_OMP_THREADS`) remain opt-in (~1.7×, bandwidth-bound).

## Naming (`5f609d2f`) — remember these
- `Overlap(f)` = ANY 1-electron `⟨i|f|j⟩` (f may be a potential); `Repulsion` = the 2-electron `1/r12`.
  So the reciprocal-space field→KS-matrix bridge is `Band_FT_IBS::MakeOverlap(f)` / evaluator
  `OverlapMatrix(f)` — **not** `MakePotential`/`PotentialMatrix`. `Make` = uncached.

## THE CP2K METHOD (Quickstep / Lippert–Hutter) — the authoritative GPW recipe (deep-dived from `~/Code/cp2k`)
Read the CP2K source (`src/grid/ref/grid_ref_{collocate,integrate}.c`, `qs_collocate_density.F`,
`qs_integrate_potential_product.F`, `pw_env/gaussian_gridlevels.F`, `task_list_methods.F`, `aobasis/ao_util.F`).
The recipe — every piece fixes a wall we hit:
1. **ANALYTIC collocation, NOT sampling.** Each primitive PRODUCT is ONE Gaussian: `p=z_a+z_b`, centre
   `R_p=(z_a R_a+z_b R_b)/p`, prefactor `exp(−z_a z_b/p·|R_ab|²)`, times a Cartesian polynomial (binomial
   re-expansion about `R_p` — CP2K's `cab_to_cxyz`; **we already have all this in `Ω`/`H2` in `GaussianRF.C`**).
   Evaluated analytically on grid points inside an exp-tail radius — never a sampled pre-summed orbital.
2. **No Gibbs ringing by construction.** The box ends where the poly×Gaussian `< eps_rho_rspace` (a smooth
   tail), so there is no truncation discontinuity. (This is the fix to the hard-`Rcut` ringing.)
3. **Integrate-back = exact adjoint** (same kernel, gather flag flipped): gathers **Hermite moments of V** over
   the same box. Only **V** is sampled (weighted by the analytic Gaussians), never the sharp orbital product —
   which is WHY it stays accurate on a coarse grid where naive sampling aliases.
4. **REL_CUTOFF multigrid, done right.** Each pair → the coarsest level with `cutoff ≥ p·rel_cutoff`
   (`gaussian_gridlevel`); V is transferred to ALL levels up front via FFT (spectral → no ringing). Analytic +
   matched grid → coarsening is accurate (unlike our sampling multigrid). This is the ~10–100× speed.
5. **Periodicity + screening, no hard cutoff.** Density is collocated from the DENSITY MATRIX `P` over
   NEIGHBOUR-LIST pairs `(i, j@cell R)` — a screened image sum (include only where `|⟨χ_i|χ_j^R⟩| > EPS_PGF_ORB`,
   default 1e-5) — with each compact box MODULO-WRAPPED onto the grid. So: a **screened** image sum (no hard
   Rcut → no ringing) PLUS the wrap (an atom at the cell edge tiles automatically). k-points: the grid density
   is always real/cell-periodic; ALL k-dependence lives in `P(R)=Σ_k w_k e^{ikR}` — collocation is k-agnostic.

## TRAPS — the distilled do-not-revisit list (full records: doc/GPWHistory.md)
1. **Aliasing-flattered energies.**  Every pre-2026-07-20 NaF number in the −27.7..−28.0 band (Ecut=40
   era) was an under-resolved-grid COINCIDENCE, not physics.  Resolved-grid truth: SR2 −24.4314 /
   SR −24.4324.  Never trust an energy whose grid fails the negCharge/XC probes.
2. **Oracles are not always oracles.**  The CP2K SR −27.93128 was a 3.50 Ha EPS_PGF_ORB screening
   artifact (truncated overlap metric × 1/λ amplification on a λ~1e-6 basis) — complete with a FAKE
   eternal density limit cycle.  Rule: CP2K oracle runs on ill-conditioned bases use tight EPS
   (`naf_gpw_sr_tight.inp`) and require REAL density convergence; also DIFF THE BASIS before comparing.
3. **MOM across a discretization change can pin an EXCITED state** (0.76 Ha on NaF; hole at −0.36 Ha
   under occupied levels).  The εH/εL gap line MASKS it — read the `frontier ε(occ)` window (0h guards).
4. **The long/short local-PP split pieces carry ~0.5 Ha grid errors that CANCEL in the sum** — never mix
   an exact piece with a band-limited partner (measured trap).  The absolute κ rule (e^{−κ/2} uniform
   pair tails) is what makes a piece standalone-exact — up to LADDER-TOP SATURATION (κ·p above the top:
   harmless only where the field is r_loc-soft — fine for LONG at production tops, why SHORT is analytic).
5. **Truncated metrics corrupt maps** (Rcut=2a lost 2.25 e; CP2K's screening = the same class).
   THERE IS NO CUT.  Also: overlap-null ≠ physics-null — but for THESE bases the near-null diffuse
   modes carry only ~1 mHa (SR↔SR2), so auto-dropping them is safe.
6. **Geometry-keyed caches + lattice image clones = unbounded growth** (the 11-GB OOMs: content-keyed
   MnD Ω/RNLM/H3 on ~2k images/pair; stream-cache pair builds materialised before tiering).  A lattice
   SERIES is consumed once — stream it (§5 LRU design retires the interim clear-based band-aid).
7. **Ops on this 14-GB box:** ONE heavy run at a time, always inside `systemd-run --user --scope
   -p MemoryMax=10G` (systemd-oomd kills by CGROUP — an unscoped run makes the DESKTOP APP take the
   blame); full-SR-class stream demand is 5.3B pts (`GPW_STREAM_BUDGET_PTS[_F32]` caps).
8. **Sampling collocation (pre-analytic era) aliases at bulk; hard Rcut rings (Gibbs)** — the analytic
   CP2K method (compact exp-tail boxes, screened image sums, modulo wrap) is the only scheme in the code.

# TODO / NEXT

**Orientation (2026-07-23).**  GPW is VALIDATED against CP2K at sub-mHa on every honest comparison (Si,
NaF-SR2 0.19 mHa, NaF-full-SR 0.10 mHa — after the CP2K SR "oracle" −27.93 was RETRACTED as its screening
artifact; TRAPS #2).  NaF production (SR2, matched grids) runs in 190 s.  The queue: §0.5 runtime (the
raster policy is the big lever), 0h SCF guards, 0i analytic long, §1 diffuse-basis robustness (demoted to
automation), then the standing items (2)–(5).

## 0.5 RUNTIME IMPROVEMENTS (the consolidated performance queue)
Current standing (all converged, same machine): Si Γ 48 s vs CP2K 3.5 s; NaF SR2 190 s vs 5.8 s (~33×);
the full-SR diagnostic ran 8.45 h vs 88.6 s — its pathology is items (b)+(c) below.  In leverage order:
- **(a) The raster POLICY — the ~8× lever.**  Full design in §0.5(a) just below.
- **(b) Free the coarse stage's stream caches after the seed handoff** (`bsC.reset()` class fix): the
  global stream budgets are consumed by the RESIDENT coarse caches, so the fine stage of a
  grid-continuation run gets ~0% coverage and re-evaluates billions of points per iteration (the 8.45-h
  run's dominant cost).
- **(c) Stream-budget follow-ups:** byte-aware per-pair transient bound (the current bound is in POINTS
  but pairs build in fp64 form — a 400M-pt fp32 budget still admits a ~5-GB build transient); the
  `[stream cache]` readout should print the EFFECTIVE (env-overridden) budgets, not the compile-time
  constants.
- **(d) B_ij(R) k-independent 1E memo** (user design: cache B(R), never M(k) — "keep k out of the key"):
  `LatticeSum` currently folds `phase(n)` into the accumulation, burying the k-independence; storing the
  per-pair, per-offset reductions once makes every additional k-block's 1E build a ~ms phase contraction
  (the `IntegrateMemo` pattern, already shared across k-blocks via the one molecular basis).  The
  multi-k enabler (Si 2×2×2: 8 builds → 1 build + 8 contractions).
- **(f) BALL-PER-ROLE re-calibration (user question 2026-07-23): one ball currently serves three roles
  with three different natural calibrations** — Hartree ρ ball ≈ 2–3·α_max (charge-converged, measured);
  the ρ FED TO the XC nonlinearity ≈ 4–8·α_max (a POINTWISE non-negativity requirement, not spectral:
  Gibbs lobes + the ρ>0 guard = the Exc collapse; the C=8 calibration's real content); the v_xc OUTPUT
  ball ≈ ρ's/3 (LDA v_xc ~ ρ^{1/3}: the cube root of a Gaussian peak has exponent p/3 — SMOOTHER than ρ,
  opposite to the GGA ∇ρ lore).  The governing ball sets the raster (∝ Ecut^{3/2}), so C 8→4 ≈ 2.8×
  fewer raster points machine-wide.  EVIDENCE C=8 is over-conservative for production: the matched NaF
  runs at Ecut=160 (C=4, CP2K's own operating point) agree with CP2K to 0.1–0.2 mHa; the 480-ball probe
  bought 0.15 mHa.  MEASURE FIRST: re-run the negCharge/XC probes at C=3,4 on production NaF (post-
  analytic-short landscape); if clean, lower the default C (zero architecture change — the divergent-ball
  plumbing exists via CreateCD/VxcFitBasisSet since the thread-through fix); the ⅓-v_xc ball is a smaller
  follow-on (G-space op counts).  CAUTION: the retired GPW_CDFIT_SCALE two-grid fork — any re-split must
  buy real money over one-grid simplicity.
- **(e) Cache2/3 byte-budget LRU** (§5, user-approved): also the robustness fix; runtime-relevant because
  it retires the per-pair `ClearGeometryCaches()` rebuild cost on healthy bases (currently unmeasurable,
  but the LRU makes the policy principled).
- (OpenMP pair loops remain opt-in `GPW_OMP_THREADS`, ~1.7× — bandwidth-bound; CP2K threads on top of
  everything, so parity ultimately needs the structural items above first.)


### 0.5(a) RASTER POLICY — the remaining ~8× raster factor vs CP2K (a designed choice, likely a knob)
At the SAME Ecut ball our raster is 72³ where CP2K's is 36³ (~8× the points).  This is not waste by
accident but a POLICY difference — and now that everything else is matched, it is the whole remaining
grid-cost gap:
- **Ours — ALIAS-FREE (difference-set) rasters:** `AutoGrid` = 4m+1 per axis (m = the ball's max index),
  so the raster resolves the full DIFFERENCE set \f$\{G-G'\}\f$: the product of ANY two ball waves
  (bandwidth 2m) is sampled exactly, the FFT of the collocated ρ gives EXACT ball coefficients, and the
  raster is a true quadrature for every \f$\langle G|f|G'\rangle\f$ with f in the ball.  Discretization
  error lives ONLY in the ball radius (Ecut) — N is never a physics dial.  This is why the 5-smooth flip
  re-pinned nothing.
- **CP2K — BALL-ONLY rasters:** N ≈ 2m+1-class (its 36 at the 160-Ha ball).  Products of two ball waves
  ALIAS on that raster — the fold-back into the ball is ACCEPTED as discretization error, controlled by
  converging CUTOFF (and softened by evaluating XC on the raw raster values).  The bet: the aliased
  product tails are the same \f$e^{-E_{cut}/2p}\f$ tails the CUTOFF calibration already budgets for, so
  paying 8× in points to capture them exactly at FIXED Ecut is wasteful — better to raise Ecut a little
  on a cheap raster if needed.
- **PROPOSED (user 2026-07-22: "sounds like a user knob"): a raster POLICY enum, not a numeric dial**
  (the no-grad-student-knobs rule): `RasterPolicy { AliasFree /*default*/, BallOnly }` at the factory
  surface, printed by `ReportGrids`.  AliasFree stays the default (correct-first; N provably not a
  physics variable).  BallOnly is the measured-efficiency option — ANOTHER ~8× on every raster-scaled
  cost (the NaF fine raster would drop to CP2K's own 36³-class, est. run ≪ 60 s).
- **VALIDATION REQUIRED before BallOnly ships (the knobs trade against each other):** the
  `cutoffFactor=8` auto-floor calibration was MEASURED on alias-free rasters — on a ball-only raster the
  product tails fold back in, so the negCharge/XC-collapse probes must be re-run (CP2K operates clean at
  C≈4 with ball-only rasters; whether that transfers to our Fourier-round-trip XC path is exactly the
  measurement).  A/B: NaF at BallOnly vs AliasFree at the same Ecut — energy within ~mHa ⇒ CP2K's bet
  confirmed for us and BallOnly can even become the default with the calibration recorded; if not, the
  8× is the honest price of our XC path and this item closes as "policy justified".


## 0h. SCF-strategy guards (banked from the validation; do with/after the §0c seams)
- **MOM cross-grid guard:** `AdoptMOMReference` across a discretization change can pin an EXCITED state
  (measured: 0.76 Ha on NaF — the transferred occupied subspace need not span the new grid's aufbau
  ground space).  Guard: detect a PERSISTENT HOLE at convergence (an unoccupied ε below an occupied ε)
  and release/re-capture MOM (or at minimum WARN loudly).
- **`ReportBandGap` hole-masking fix:** the εH/εL summary line takes εL from the lowest virtual ABOVE
  the HOMO index and printed gap=0.67 while a −0.36 Ha virtual sat BELOW occupied levels; take εL over
  ALL unoccupied and flag non-aufbau.  (The `frontier ε(occ)` window was the honest instrument.)

## 0i. Analytic V_local LONG — DEMOTED to robustness/perf (was the §0e-PP crux)
With (a)+(b) landed, the SHORT is analytic in production and the grid LONG is standalone-exact to the
ladder top (κ rule) — NaF sits 0.19 mHa from CP2K, so the analytic LONG is no longer an accuracy
blocker.  Kept on the list for ROBUSTNESS (very hard PPs / deliberately cheap ladders, where ladder-top
saturation shows — the §0e-PP saturation corollary) and to delete the LAST V_loc grid sweep entirely.
The recorded crux, unchanged: the LONG's `−Z_ion·Repulsion3C(χᵢ,χⱼ,g_core)` lattice sum (the erf-Coulomb
IS a normalized Gaussian core charge, exp `1/2r_loc²`) is conditionally convergent (erf→1/r Madelung
tail) ⇒ needs the G-space/Ewald neutralizing background, NOT a real-space sum — i.e. CP2K's ρ_core-into-
the-Poisson-solve arrangement, which for us means folding the core charge into `PW_Hartree`'s existing
G-space solve rather than assembling a separate matrix.  Kernels all exist (`GaussianRF`, no new Boys
function); verification gates: Si Γ −7.11506 + NaF SR2 −24.4312 (both codes' clean oracle pair).

Then the standing queue: **(1) DROP SR** (rank-reduction + auto-tol, below); **(2) low-q multi-species
bases → Si/NaF/CsI**; **(3) CP2K reference library**; **(4) IBZ**; **(5) cleanups**.

## 1. ROBUST HANDLING OF DIFFUSE BASIS FUNCTIONS (was "DROP SR"; demoted from critical path 2026-07-23)
**Goal: a grad student can add diffuse functions AT WILL; the code detects near-null overlap modes,
drops them in the ORTHO TRANSFORM (never the basis), WARNS loudly, and everything downstream just
works.**  Now known SAFE (the dropped modes carry ~1 mHa — the SR↔SR2 measurement) and known NON-URGENT
(λ~1e-6 runs stably via Cholesky + the seeded-aufbau recipe — the §1 probe).  Essential steps:
1. **Rectangular V through the periodic stack** (the real work; unblocks `DISABLED_NaFFullBasisEigenTol`):
   a truncated ortho (V is n×(n−k)) must flow through `Crystal_EC` (band count n−k), `cDM_CD` (density
   stays full n×n via C=V·U′), and the collocation — mirror the molecular path's rectangular handling.
2. **Auto-tol via LASolver GAP DETECTION** (pure LA): force-drop d[i]≤0; scan the low spectrum for the
   largest consecutive ratio; ratio > R_threshold (default 30, exposed at the Calculation facade) = a
   clean gap → cut there; else ε-tol fallback + WARN.  `orthoTol<0`=auto / `=0`=none / `>0`=explicit
   (mirrors `densityEcut`).
3. **NEVER SILENT**: every auto-drop reports count + gap ratio + clean/ambiguous on `cerr`; a λ_min /
   condition-number line joins the run-start diagnostics (`ReportGrids` sibling) so conditioning is
   visible BEFORE it bites.
4. **Default-path SCF robustness** (with 0h): the seeded-aufbau/MOM-guard recipe that tames these bases
   lives in test env knobs today — promote the working policy into the facade defaults.
5. **Gates**: full-basis (VALENCE_LOWQ) NaF == the SR/SR2 answers ± the dropped-mode mHa; Si anchors
   untouched; the never-silent WARN asserted in a test.
Vision: collapse to ~one CP2K-like ε.  (Auto-Rcut half is DONE — enumeration is ε-complete in-seam.)


## 2. Low-q multi-species bases → Si/NaF/CsI cross-validation (PW + GPW + CP2K)

**Valence-basis GENERATOR — DONE** (`qchem.ValenceBasisGen`; full record: doc/GPWHistory.md): pseudo-atom
SCF → even-tempered valence blocks → `BasisSetData/valence_lowq.bsd` (F 8s+6p E=−21.10, Na 5s+2p E=−0.144;
enum `VALENCE_LOWQ`), tests `UnitTests/ValenceBasisGen_UT.C`.  Pinned lessons: validate against the physically
relevant CHARGE STATE (F⁻ for NaF); oracle GS-energy matching is the WRONG objective (N≈8 windows, refine later
from a NaF orbital-coefficient heat-map); keep per-l exponents DISJOINT (the shared-exponent Gaussian94 reader
bug is flagged in `PG_Cart/Imp/IrrepBasisSet.C` — flipping it re-pins every density-fit anchor).  NEXT: Cs/I.

Hand-roll SIPP-style **low-q valence Gaussian bases** for Na/F/Cs/I so GPW (and CP2K) can run NaF + CsI, then
triangulate our two codes against CP2K on Si/NaF/CsI. Unblocks **multi-species GPW** (the battery-oxide path,
[[project_battery_voltage_goal]]) and yields the CP2K runtimes. The CP2K reference library (§2) is the oracle.

**Why blocked today.** Our GTH PPs are low-q — verified in `gth_potentials.json` LDA: **Na q1, F q7, Cs q1,
I q7** (Na/Cs also ship q9 semicore; F/I only q7). CP2K ships only q9 semicore Gaussian bases for Na/Cs and
**no GTH basis for iodine**, so it aborts on the valence mismatch. The fix is a matched low-q Gaussian valence
basis — which **GPW needs anyway** (GPW = Gaussian orbitals), so the work is shared.

**Include PW? YES — it is the basis-INDEPENDENT anchor, nearly free.** Our plane-wave code needs NO Gaussian
basis (orbitals ARE plane waves; only PP + Ecut) and already has NaF −20.3293 (Ecut=6) / CsI −11.3868 (Ecut=4)
[`606a54ff`]. Converging its Ecut gives the complete-basis limit. Three-way triangulation:
- **GPW vs CP2K** (SAME Gaussian basis + PP + functional) → IMPLEMENTATION correctness (the tight gate).
- **GPW vs PW** (Gaussian basis vs complete) → BASIS quality (the gap = Gaussian incompleteness; GPW ≥ PW in
  energy, i.e. less bound, as an incomplete basis under-binds).
- **PW vs CP2K** (both → complete-basis as CP2K's basis grows + cutoffs converge) → cross-code sanity.
PW is the leg that separates "is our GPW code correct" from "is the Gaussian basis good enough."

**Basis recipe (mirror `sipp.bsd`/`sipp_sr.bsd`).** Uncontracted even-tempered valence (one primitive per .bsd
shell, `nprim=1 coeff=1`), + a `_SR` variant dropping the most-diffuse primitive(s) for Bloch conditioning
(the SIPP→SIPP_SR lesson: ill-conditioning is a BASIS problem, [[feedback_scf_accuracy_levels]]). Valence
shells (from the PP q):

| el | q (Zion) | valence | shells | notes |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| Na | 1 | 3s¹ | s (+p polar) | 1 val e⁻ (alkali) |
| F  | 7 | 2s²2p⁵ | s+p | tight 2p → hard atom, higher cutoff |
| Cs | 1 | 6s¹ | s (+p) | heavy, diffuse 6s |
| I  | 7 | 5s²5p⁵ | s+p | **no GTH Gaussian basis anywhere** — first one; soft, big r_loc |

Seed α_max from the GTH `r_loc`, α_min from the valence ⟨r⟩, ratio ~2.5–3 (SIPP s = 2.0/0.7/0.25). New files:
`BasisSetData/{na,f,cs,i}_lowq{,_sr}.bsd` + `BasisSetData` enum entries + the loader map (mirror sipp/sipp_sr).

**NLCC vs semicore — decision point when the TM-oxide (Mn/Ni/Co, battery-track) bases are built.**  Our XC
is valence-only (E_xc[ρ_val], v_xc[ρ_val]) — CORRECT for the GTH-PADE set we ship (`gth_potentials.json`
has NO NLCC/core-charge entries; the core-valence XC linearization is absorbed at PP generation, and CP2K
runs the same PPs the same way, so all oracles are apples-to-apples).  The GTH remedy where linearization
fails (spin-polarized TM cores) is historically SEMICORE promotion (the Na q1→q9 pattern; sharp semicore
density → much higher grid cutoff), the alternative is NLCC-GTH (Willand 2013 style; CP2K supports an NLCC
section).  If NLCC is chosen: the core density is an analytic per-atom Gaussian → ONE more static
collocation onto the same grid (like the local-PP sweep), then ε_xc/v_xc evaluated at ρ_val+ρ_core in BOTH
the energy and the integrate-back field; ∂ρ_core/∂D=0 so H_xc stays the exact gradient and the
`XCPotentialConsistencyFD` gate covers it unchanged.  Forces add the core-motion term (forces increment).

**Validation loop (per element → per compound).**
1. Build the `.bsd` (+ SR variant).
2. Finite pseudo-ATOM cross-check (the `SiPseudoAtomInBoxMatchesFinite` pattern): `Calculation(atom,
   {.basis=…, .pseudopotential=true})` converges, and GPW-in-box == that finite molecular DFT. Converge the
   basis by adding/tightening functions — NOT against Slater/High (different basis, a loose oracle: SIPP Si
   −3.759 vs Slater/High −3.337).
3. Transcribe the `.bsd` → CP2K `BASIS_SET` format (`El NAME`, nset, per-set `n lmin lmax nexp nshell` +
   exponent/coeff — the `UnitTests/CP2K/SIPP-SR-BASIS` pattern) + a CP2K deck (mirror `si_fcc_gpw*.inp`,
   `POTENTIAL GTH-PADE-q{1,7}`).
4. **Compounds:** NaF (rocksalt FCC), CsI (CsCl simple-cubic). Run **PW, GPW, CP2K**. Record Etot + runtime in
   `doc/CP2Kresults.md`; add did-E-move anchors: GPW → `GPW_SCF`, PW → `PlaneWaveDFTUT`.

**Multi-species GPW plumbing (small — the bases are the real work).** `Ham_PW_DFT` already has the multi-
species ctor (`{{"Na",1},{"F",7}}`, PW path `606a54ff`) and it drives GPW verbatim, so GPW multi-species =
thread the species→q map through `RunGPW`/`GPWFactory` in place of the single `element`/`q=4`. Ewald + the G=0
alignment are already per-atom (Zion per species); `MultiSpecies_Local/SeparablePotential` routers exist.
**DONE — multi-species GPW FIRST LIGHT (2026-07-11): NaF rocksalt Γ converges** (multi-species `Ham_PW_DFT`
ctor `{{"Na",1},{"F",7}}` on the generated `valence_lowq` basis, Na 5s2p + F 8s6p): 22 iters, **charge=8
conserved**, Etot=−25.086 (Enn=−14.00 = ionic Madelung, matches PW). Grid-underconverged (`densityEcut=40`,
Rcut=0) so not yet comparable to PW −20.3293. Gate `GPW_SCF.DISABLED_NaFRocksaltGamma` (~140 s: F's tight
40-a.u. exponent forces a fine density grid). Rcut=2a + SR basis (PSD overlap) → Etot=−23.556 (removes ~1.5 Ha
of the Rcut=0 over-binding).

**NaF cross-validation PINS (2026-07-11; full record: doc/GPWHistory.md):** both codes agree the answer FOR
THIS GAUSSIAN BASIS is ≈ −23.6 (CP2K transiently passes −23.64 vs our −23.556); the ~3.3 Ha gap to PW's
complete-basis −20.3293 is Gaussian-basis INCOMPLETENESS (the "GPW vs PW = basis quality" leg).  The SCF
instability root is the near-singular Bloch overlap METRIC (min eig 7.5e-4, cond≈8000 at SR), NOT occupation;
magnitude screening fixes the TRUNCATION artifacts but not intrinsic over-completeness → SR stays until §1.

**Gates / deliverables.** `doc/CP2Kresults.md` rows Si/NaF/CsI × {PW, GPW, CP2K} (Etot + runtime); `GPW_SCF`
NaF/CsI converge (charge, Etot) == CP2K same-basis; the GPW−PW gap documented (basis quality). **Pitfalls:**
iodine is the first GTH Gaussian basis for the element (validate its pseudo-atom carefully); F's tight 2p is
the hardest (needs the highest cutoff, per the PW NaF vs CsI experience — F set the cutoff, not the heavy I).

## 3. CP2K reference library (the oracle for §2) — BUILT; growing it
CP2K's Quickstep **is** the reference GPW implementation (Lippert–Hutter); its per-term breakdown points
straight at a bug (as this session's hand-rolled breakdown did: Een ×15.7 → local PP → the raster).
I can run CP2K directly: `~/Code/cp2k/build/bin/cp2k.ssmp`, decks in `~/Code/cp2k-runs/`.
- **DONE — CP2K 2026.1 built** (serial ssmp, gcc 15.2) at `~/Code/cp2k` (sibling to qchem6, outside the git
  tree). Toolchain: OpenBLAS+FFTW+libxc+libxsmm+DBCSR, no MPI/libint. Build: `tools/toolchain/build_cp2k.sh`
  (CMake, NOT the old arch-file `make`). Run needs `source install/setup` +
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=install/lib`.
- **DONE — FCC-Si Γ reference (SIPP_SR, GTH-PADE-q4, LDA_X+VWN5):** **Etot = −7.11506 Ha, charge 8**,
  converged by `CUTOFF` 80 Ry (≈40 Ha). Breakdown: Core-H (kin+PP) +5.565, Hartree +10.380, XC −2.544;
  PP total −7.548 (local −8.489, nonlocal +0.941); core self-energy −20.516. (CP2K's GPW electrostatic split
  differs from ours — compare the TOTAL + the cleaner sub-terms kin/XC/nonlocal-PP.) **Γ gate — MET** (−7.11506).
  Also Si **2×2×2 = −7.86744 Ha** (`si_fcc_gpw_222.inp`). Results table: **`doc/CP2Kresults.md`**; decks:
  **`UnitTests/CP2K/`**.
- **PP already aligned:** our `src/Pseudopotential/Data/gth_potentials.json` IS the CP2K GTH-PADE database
  (Si GTH-PADE-q4 params match ours exactly — verified). **Basis: same exponents, transcribed to CP2K
  `BASIS_SET` format** (uncontracted → one set per primitive; see `UnitTests/CP2K/SIPP-SR-BASIS`).
- **NaF/CsI:** the hand-rolled low-q bases + decks are now **§1's plan** (was "blocked"; the plan resolves it).
- **Si 2×2×2 cross-checks DONE + validated:** `si_fcc_gpw_222.inp` (shifted MP, **−7.86744** == our GPW after
  the complex-k fix) + `si_fcc_gpw_222_gamma.inp` (Γ-centred, **−7.77846**, matches our GPW −7.7778).

### Parameters to line up (qchem ↔ CP2K) — keep this table current
| quantity | qchem (ours) | CP2K keyword | note / pitfall |
|---|---|---|---|
| method | GPW | `&DFT &QS METHOD GPW` | (CP2K default is GPW) |
| cell | FCC primitive, a=10.26 a.u. | `&CELL` (A/B/C vectors, `BOHR`) | match lattice vectors exactly; `PERIODIC XYZ` |
| atoms | Si (0,0,0),(¼,¼,¼) frac | `&COORD SCALED` | match fractional coords (the corner atom at 0 is the bug trigger — compare it deliberately) |
| pseudopotential | GTH-LDA q4 (Zion=4) | `POTENTIAL GTH-PADE-q4` | same params (ours from CP2K) |
| orbital basis | SIPP_SR (3s3p, uncontracted) | `BASIS_SET` (our exponents, CP2K format) | convert file; keep it uncontracted |
| exchange | Slater/Dirac Xα=2/3 | LIBXC `LDA_X` | equivalent |
| correlation | **VWN5** | LIBXC `LDA_C_VWN` (=VWN5) | **NOT `PADE`** (that's PZ correlation) — must force VWN5 |
| density cutoff | `densityEcut` (Ha) | `&MGRID CUTOFF` (**Ry**) | **1 Ha = 2 Ry**; ours 8–12 Ha = 16–24 Ry is ~10× too low (CP2K default 300–600 Ry) — see TODO 1 |
| multigrid | single grid | `&MGRID NGRIDS`, `REL_CUTOFF` (Ry) | start `NGRIDS 1` to match; align `REL_CUTOFF` later |
| k-points | `MakeKMesh(shift)` (MP; shift=0 Γ-centred, shift=½ classic MP) | `&KPOINTS SCHEME MONKHORST-PACK` | CP2K's MP is SHIFTED (k=±¼ for even N) — use `kShift=½` to match; its Γ-centred list needs `SCHEME GENERAL` (see `si_fcc_gpw_222_gamma.inp`). CP2K prints its k-list (`grep BRILLOUIN`). Complex-k FIXED (`745d03ff`); the shifted gate awaits revalidation through the analytic kernels (§0a). |

| **energy breakdown** | Ekin, Een, Eee, Exc, Enn, Ealign | CP2K: Overlap, Core (kinetic+PP), Hartree, XC, Core-self/Ewald | **term SPLITS differ** — match the TOTAL first, then map sub-terms (kinetic, XC are the cleanest to compare) |

## 4. Symmorphic space groups + auto-IBZ (deferred qcSymmetry track)
Only the POINT-GROUP part matters for k-reduction. Cubic Si (O_h, centrosymmetric) → IBZ = 1/48 of the BZ,
no time-reversal factor. Validate bit-level: reduced-mesh-with-weights == full-mesh (against Step 2). The IBZ
is an *efficiency* layer, not a correctness requirement — hence it comes AFTER a working full-BZ reference.

## 5. Deferred cleanups (do once bulk works — "the working code is the definitive declaration")
- **ISP-split `PW_Grid_Evaluator` for the fit-basis ctor (user, 2026-07-23).**  `PlaneWaveFit_IBS` is
  built from the whole `PW_Grid_Evaluator`, which fuses THREE things: the Ecut BALL (the fit set — the
  part the user rightly wants passed explicitly), the raster/quadrature engine (NOT irrelevant: the fit
  basis owns its integration machinery — RhoOnGrid/Integral/GridPoints drive the whole XC route, the
  Fitting-campaign item-K design + the uniform-interface pin), and the ORBITAL tier
  (Kinetic/Nuclear/Eval/LocalPotentialMatrix — genuinely irrelevant baggage for a fit basis).  Clean
  shape: a `PW_Ball` data type (recip, k, Ecut, {G}) under `PW_Evaluator`, ctor `(ball, gridEngine)`
  with the grid engine as the `G_FieldEvaluator` face alone — makes ball-vs-raster structural instead
  of documentary (this week's confusion is the evidence it matters).
- **Cache2/Cache3 BYTE-BUDGET LRU + per-cache RAM report (user-approved 2026-07-23; the intended
  REPLACEMENT for the clear-based band-aid).**  The MnD geometry caches (Ω/RNLM/H3) currently stay
  correct on lattice paths only because the drivers call `ClearGeometryCaches()` per pair and the 3C
  kernel ships a duplicated `Overlap3CStream` — cache-then-clear is the WRONG shape (user).  The clean
  design: give Cache2/Cache3 a BYTE budget with LRU eviction (`RAMsize()` plumbing exists), and let the
  ALGORITHM (not the user) select the policy per scope — a lattice driver pushes a scoped tiny budget
  (size-1 preserves the `const&`-returning contract AND the within-triple component reuse at O(1)
  memory), molecular paths keep the generous default.  One mechanism with per-cache specificity
  (Ω/RNLM/H3); the `ClearGeometryCaches()` calls and `Overlap3CStream` duplication then RETIRE.  Also:
  extend the end-of-run `IntegralsCache RAM usage report` with per-cache byte sizes (growth visible in
  every log instead of discovered by OOM).
- **Rigorous periodic external PP:** `MakeLocalPP`/`MakeSeparablePP` quadrature the HOME-CELL orbitals against
  the cell's OWN atoms (no periodic-image PP) — exact at Γ / large box, an approximation for a dense crystal.
  Sum the PP over lattice images (analogous to Ewald / the PW G-space assembly).
- **DRY the PP field adapters into `qcPseudopotential`:** `RealYlm`/`BetaYlmField` are byte-identical in
  `PP_{Local,NonLocal}.C` (molecular terms) and replicated in the GPW evaluator. Hoist into a public module in
  `qcPseudopotential` (below both libs). Pure refactor; verify `L_PP` + `A_PP` + `GPW_SCF` unchanged.
- **`cMesh` = `Mesh<dcmplx>` (user-directed):** the `(Rs, phases)` pair (a `{R}` + `{e^{ik·R}}` weighted point
  set) and the density/quadrature grids should collapse to a `template<class W=double> class Mesh` — the
  integration algorithm is identical for real/complex weights, only the weight TYPE differs (confirmed vs
  `src/Mesh/Quadrature.C`). Then a `FourierMesh_R` ({R}) and `FourierMesh_k` ({k} + real BZ weights, unifies
  with today's `KMesh`). A cross-cutting refactor (Quadrature.C + bit-identity across ~29 consumers);
  currently marked with `// future: one cMesh` comments.
- **GGA Vxc fit grid (`relCutoff`) — CORRECTNESS for GGA, guarded now (`44bebe88`):** GPW uses ONE absolute
  `densityEcut` grid for both ρ (Hartree) and v_xc, and `GPW_IBS::CreateCD/VxcFitBasisSet` IGNORE `mp.relCutoff`
  (the CP2K REL_CUTOFF the Hamiltonian derives from the functional's `GridCutoffFactor()`; `PlaneWave_IBS` DOES
  honor it, building its Vxc grid at `Ecut*relCutoff`). LDA relCutoff==1 so it's exact — but a GGA's ∇ρ wants a
  DENSER v_xc grid. Fix = build a separate Vxc grid at `densityEcut*relCutoff`, mirroring the PW Vxc line. A
  guard `assert(relCutoff<=1)` now fires loudly on a GGA-on-GPW attempt instead of silently using the LDA grid.
  **PREREQUISITE NOW IN PLACE (2026-07-20): the fit-grid seam is honest.**  Previously `GPW`'s
  `MakeRepulsion3C(c)`/`MakeOverlap3C(c)` (the shared `EPW_Orbital_DFT_IBS` mixin) DROPPED the fit basis `c`
  and rebuilt the tensor from the block's own `itsGrid` — so a denser `CreateVxcFitBasisSet` grid would have
  been SILENTLY IGNORED (the policy factory and the tensor builder were two disconnected sources of truth for
  the density-fit `{G}`, reconciled only by both hard-coding `DensityGrid()`).  Now `GPW_IBS` overrides those
  two seams to build the tensor over the REQUESTED fit basis's grid (`c` IS-A `PW_Grid_Evaluator`;
  `GPW_Evaluator::Repulsion3CTensor(grid)`/`Overlap3CTensor(grid)` + a grid-parameterized `BuildLevels` ladder).
  Bit-identical while the factory wraps `DensityGrid()` (Si Γ −7.11485 / multi-k −7.45133 / adjoint
  machine-exact / all GPW gates green), and the block's own `OverlapMatrix`/`MakeLocalPP` (KS-assembly, not a
  requested table) keep `itsGrid`.  So densifying `CreateVxcFitBasisSet` will now ACTUALLY take effect for the
  collocated ρ̃ — the GGA increment can diverge the CD/Vxc grids without the tensor silently overriding it.
  (PW's own `relCutoff` Vxc path — `PlaneWaveDFT.ItemK_RelCutoffDensifiesAndConvergesVxc` — was left untouched,
  deliberately not lumped into the GPW-scoped fix; audit it separately if the shared mixin is ever unified.)
- **Multi-grids + whole-density collocation — DONE** (the C+D analytic rewrite, see the DONE entry).
- **Common `PW_Evaluator`/`GPW_Evaluator` base:** the shared FFT engine (`PeriodicGridEvaluator`) is already
  factored; a base earns its keep once general-k k-space logic is shared.

---

# Durable pins / invariants (carry into all GPW work)
- **THERE IS NO CUT — IN THE R DIRECTION (user pin, 2026-07-16).**  Real-space lattice sums are
  ε-CONVERGED SERIES for a FIXED operator: magnitude screening is the ONLY truncation mechanism; a radius
  must never appear as a parameter, member, or concept in any interface — not user-facing, not internal.
  A truncation radius yields a DIFFERENT operator, not "the operator to ε" (measured: the Rcut=2a NaF
  metric lost 2.25 e per mid-slosh loading), AND must never be a conditioning crutch (that job belongs to
  the basis or to rank-reduction).  The G DIRECTION is different in kind: the Ecut ball is a PROJECTION
  onto a finite auxiliary subspace — variational (adjoint-exact), exponentially controlled, systematically
  improvable — i.e. a legitimate resolution dial, not a cut.  End state: ONE knob per direction —
  ε in R (convergence tolerance), Ecut in G (projection resolution).
- **PP-smoothness is GPW's enabler; GAPW is out of scope (first pass).** All-electron cores are too sharp;
  validate with a well-conditioned GTH valence basis, never all-electron.
- **Use well-conditioned bases for SCF.** Ill-conditioning is a BASIS problem, not a solver/code bug (SIPP
  diffuse → SIPP_SR; N3/N5 removed). "LASolver" symptoms are basis conditioning. `N3/N5` no longer exist.
- **GPW is a Coulomb/Hartree STRATEGY orthogonal to the orbital basis** — a third one beside exact-4-centre
  (`Vee`) and density-fitting (`FittedVee`). Same `⟨χ|V_H|χ⟩` out, different internals.
- **Never assume `orbital == fit`.** Any fit/aux basis comes from the orbital basis via `Create{CD,Vxc}
  FitBasisSet(...)` — the factory is the seam even when trivial.
- **Fit quality is measured by grid-convergence of ρ, NEVER by ΔE_total** (the fit is non-variational).
- **Spin-polarized is the native formulation**; unpolarized is the ζ=0 collapse. New periodic terms
  spin-native (`FittedVxcPol`/`FittedVcorrPol`).
- **Regression style:** periodic/GPW energies are "did-E-move" anchors (pin the converged value, no
  `Converged()` guard). Where a real-space-on-lattice quantity must equal its finite counterpart, assert
  bit-consistency (`L_PP`-style) rather than an absolute oracle.
- **Two self-consistent schemes — do NOT mix:** (A) complete-Bloch analytic single-sum matrices (what GPW
  has, correct as Rcut→∞); (B) truncated-Bloch collocation Gram matrices (always PSD). Scheme-B overlap +
  scheme-A analytic kinetic gave `Ekin=−300`. Stay in scheme A at a converged Rcut (overlap PSD there).

### Symmetry comes AFTER a working GPW (independent optimisation layer, does not gate GPW)
Symmorphic space groups → BZ reduction (irreducible wedge) → SALC with plane waves. None of these gate GPW.
