# Molecular ↔ Plane-Wave Pseudopotential Harmonization — Round 2 (the road to GPW)

**Status:** planning doc for the *next* session. Self-contained. Author-owned (like
`doc/MolecularPP_HarmonizationFindings.md`, "Round 1"); **not** the user's
`doc/MolecularPseudopotentialPlan.md`. Round 1 got molecular pseudopotentials working and harmonized the
*fitting/assembly* seams; Round 2 closes the last structural divergences and lays the track to **GPW**
(Gaussian orbitals on a periodic lattice), which is the north-star that makes solids/battery work possible.

---

## 0. Orientation (read this first — the doc is otherwise standalone)

Two pseudopotential (PP) code paths exist today and they must eventually share as much machinery as possible:

- **Molecular** (`src/Hamiltonian`, `double`, real-space, finite geometry): the external PP is assembled in the
  **term** — `PP_Local` (local part `⟨χᵢ|V_loc(r)|χⱼ⟩`) and `PP_NonLocal` (Kleinman–Bylander separable part
  `⟨χᵢ|β_p Yₗₘ⟩`), each quadratured on the geometry's own integration mesh.
- **Plane-wave / lattice** (`src/BasisSet/Lattice_3D` + `src/Hamiltonian/…/PWTerms.C`, `dcmplx`, reciprocal
  space, periodic): the PP is assembled in the **basis** — `PlaneWave_IBS` realizes
  `Integrals_Pseudo<dcmplx>` (structure factor `e^{-iG·τ}`, `1/Ω`, form factors), reached from the
  `PW_Pseudo` term by a `dynamic_cast` across abstract faces.

They already share a **spine** (this is what Round 1 established or confirmed):

| Shared object / algorithm | Role |
|---|---|
| `LocalPotential` / `SeparablePotential` (`src/Pseudopotential`) | the PP **models** (real + reciprocal views); both sides consume the same model |
| `Structure::CreateIntegrationMesh(mp)` (pure virtual) | each geometry owns its most efficient real-space mesh: `Atom`→radial×angular, `Molecule`→Becke, `UnitCell`→uniform grid. PW never calls it (owns its G-grid). |
| `Structure::SumFormFactors(f)` + `isFinite()` | the neutral G=0 alignment seam (finite → 0; periodic → folds in `1/Ω`), no `dynamic_cast<UnitCell>` |
| `NuclearRepulsion(st, zionOf)` | one ion-ion algorithm: pair-sum (finite) / Ewald (periodic); both `Vnn` and `PW_IonIon` delegate |
| `Fit_ABS` factory + `FunctionFitter_{Scalar,Density}<T>` | density/potential fitting; **both** sides now obtain their fitter through `bs->Create{CD,Vxc}FitBasisSet(...)` (Round 1 Item 2 — PW no longer assumes `orbital == fit`; `FourierFunctionFitter` retired) |

The map (colour-coded; **✓** = harmonized, **◐** = partly done, amber = the divergences this doc plans):

![Molecular vs plane-wave PP — shared spine + divergence points](diagrams/pp_molecular_vs_pw.svg)

**What Round 1 finished** (so we don't re-open it): `PseudoG0Energy` eliminated; `Integrals_Pseudo<T>` reduced
to two clean matrix methods (PW-only, `<dcmplx>`); both molecular PP terms made geometry-neutral on
`CreateIntegrationMesh`; multi-species routing; spin-native `Ham_PP` (`FittedVxcPol`/`FittedVcorrPol`, now pinned
by `A_PP.Si_PP_U.Polarized`); the whole PW DFT-fit path routed through the basis factory (Hartree + XC), with the
uniform `UnitCell` mesh + `L_PP` term-level validation in place. Full detail: `MolecularPP_HarmonizationFindings.md`
§6. **The "LASolver blocker" of Round 1 §5.1 was a red herring — near-singular basis conditioning, not a solver
bug; use a well-conditioned basis (Slater/High).**

---

## 1. The four remaining "incidental" divergences

"Incidental" = an artifact of how the two sides grew up, not a reflection of real physics (contrast the
**principled** divergence real-space `V(r)` vs reciprocal `ṽ(G²)`, which we *keep*). Each is a harmonization /
hoisting target. They are listed easy→hard; **(A) and (D) are ultimately the same problem, and GPW is what forces
them** (see §2).

**Where each divergence now lands (after GPW prep work 1):**
- **(C)** is **DONE** — peeled off as a standalone template (`IonIon<T>`), independent of GPW. ✅
- **(A), (B), (D)** all **fold into GPW**: (D) is the GPW body (real-space-basis SCF on a `UnitCell`); (A)
  dissolves under it (molecular term path + `UnitCell` mesh *is* the GPW KS-matrix assembly — do **not** pre-empt
  it with a molecular `Integrals_Pseudo<double>`); (B), the G=0 alignment, is a **PP-term** (electron-ion) concern
  that folds into (D)'s unified PP local term (it needs `FormFactorG0`, not an ion-ion quantity — see (C)'s note).
  So GPW is the single forcing function for the last three.

### (B) G=0 alignment — trivially unifiable, do it opportunistically
- **Now:** the PP G=0 term is `0` for a finite structure and `(N/Ω)·Σ_a FormFactorG0(Z_a)` for a periodic one.
  `PW_Pseudo::GetEnergy` already branches on `!isFinite()` and reads the sum from `Structure::SumFormFactors`.
  The molecular side carries a hardcoded `0.0`.
- **Target:** when a single PP term serves all geometries (see (D)), it carries one expression
  `Ealign = isFinite() ? 0 : N·SumFormFactors(FormFactorG0)`. No new abstraction — the seam already exists.
- **Effort:** trivial (folds into (D)). **Risk:** none (bit-identical; finite value is provably 0).
- **Confirmed while doing (C):** this is a **PP-term** (electron-ion) concern, *not* ion-ion — `FormFactorG0`
  is the local-PP model's finite `G→0` limit. It genuinely folds into **(D)** (the unified PP local term), *not*
  into `IonIon<T>`. `PW_Pseudo::GetEnergy` keeps it for now (the seam is right where it is).

### ✅ (C) ~~`IonIon<T>` — collapse `Vnn` and `PW_IonIon` into one template~~

> # ✅ DONE — GPW prep work 1
> Collapsed into `template<class T> class IonIon` (`src/Hamiltonian/Internal/IonIon.C`). `Vnn` + `PW_IonIon`
> deleted; 176/176 UTMain green, per-side anchors bit-identical. Detail below.

- **Now:** `Vnn` (`rsmat_t`, molecular) and `PW_IonIon` (`chmat_t`, periodic) are **the same energy-only term** —
  both add no matrix contribution and delegate to `NuclearRepulsion(st, zionOf)`. They differ only in scalar type.
- **Target:** one `IonIon<T>` term (`T ∈ {double, dcmplx}`), parameterized by the `zionOf` callback
  (identity for all-electron, `Z→Zion` map for PP). Mirrors how the two PP terms already share their model + mesh.
- **DONE:** new module `qchem.Hamiltonian.Internal.IonIon` (`src/Hamiltonian/Internal/IonIon.C`) exports
  `template<class T> class IonIon : tStatic_HT<T> / tStatic_HT_Imp<T>` — fully inline (a template term needs its
  definition visible where instantiated), sitting on the shared `qchem.Hamiltonian.Internal.Term` base where
  **both** the `double` and `dcmplx` term bases are visible (the "different libs" watch-item was actually just a
  module placement). Two ctors: all-electron convenience `IonIon(st)` + PP `IonIon(st, zionOf)`. `Vnn` (class +
  `Imp/Vnn.C`) and `PW_IonIon` (class + impl block) **deleted**; the four build/test sites now say
  `IonIon<double>` / `IonIon<dcmplx>`: `HamiltonianImp::InsertStandardTerms`, `Ham_PP`, `Ham_PW_DFT::BuildTerms`,
  and `PlaneWaveDFT.VnnPeriodicUsesEwald`. **176/176 UTMain green** — the per-side anchors held bit-identical
  (`VnnPeriodicUsesEwald` Ewald Madelung `-8.40046`; `A_PP.Si_PP_U.Polarized` `-3.359597907`; `L_PP` finite==lattice).
- **NOTE — (B) did NOT fold into `IonIon`.** §3.1 said "(B) folded into it," but the G=0 alignment needs
  `FormFactorG0`, which is the **local-PP model** (`PP_Local` / `PW_Pseudo`, electron-ion), not an ion-ion
  quantity — putting it on `IonIon` would be a wrong coupling. So the alignment stayed in `PW_Pseudo` (per the (B)
  section's own authoritative "folds into (D)"). `IonIon<T>` is a pure ion-ion energy term. See (B) below.

### (A) Assembly-in-term vs assembly-in-basis — the headline
- **Now:** molecular assembles in the **term** (`PP_Local`/`PP_NonLocal` + `CreateIntegrationMesh` + generic
  `qcMesh` quadrature); PW assembles in the **basis** (`Integrals_Pseudo<dcmplx>` via `dynamic_cast`).
- **Key insight (do not "fix" by writing a molecular `Integrals_Pseudo<double>`):** the pure PW path is
  *principled* — reciprocal-space assembly on its own G-grid is the efficient, correct thing, and it should stay.
  The molecular term path is *also* principled and is already geometry-neutral. They **converge only when a
  real-space (Gaussian) basis lives on a lattice** — that basis will quadrature its PP with the *molecular term
  path on a `UnitCell` mesh*, exactly like a finite `Molecule`. That is GPW. So (A) is **not** a refactor to do
  in isolation; it is **resolved by (D)/GPW**.
- **Effort:** none standalone — it dissolves under (D). **Risk:** the trap is "unify by giving molecular an
  `Integrals_Pseudo<double>`" — explicitly rejected: it would drag reciprocal-space assumptions into the molecular
  basis for zero benefit.

### (D) Full lattice-PP **SCF** — the real increment
- **Now:** the molecular PP terms already assemble correctly on a `UnitCell`'s uniform mesh — proven bit-identical
  by `L_PP` (`UnitTests/L_PP.C`: the same Si valence Gaussian basis + GTH PP gives the same `PP_Local`/
  `PP_NonLocal` matrices whether the atom is a finite `Molecule` or centred in a large `UnitCell`). But there is
  **no periodic SCF** with a real-space basis: two things are missing.
  1. **Periodic Gaussians.** Overlap / kinetic / Hartree of Gaussians on a lattice need Bloch sums
     (`Σ_R e^{ik·R} χ(r−R)`) and lattice-summed two-centre integrals (minimum-image or Ewald-style long-range).
     This is the substantive new numerics.
  2. **The facade must preserve the concrete geometry.** `qchem::Calculation`'s ctor does
     `itsStructure = std::make_shared<Molecule>(st)` — it **deep-copies any structure to a `Molecule`, stripping
     periodicity**. A lattice calculation must keep the `UnitCell` (and its `CreateIntegrationMesh` → uniform grid,
     and `Vnn`→Ewald). This is a small but load-bearing facade change and a **prerequisite for GPW**.
- **Target:** a real-space-basis SCF on a `UnitCell` reusing `PP_Local`/`PP_NonLocal`/`IonIon` unchanged.
- **Effort:** large (this is the GPW body). **Risk:** medium-high (new periodic-integral numerics); de-risk with
  the term-level `L_PP` bit-identity already in hand and the empty-lattice / cosine-V / bare-Coulomb PW anchors.

## 2. Strategic roadmap: symmetry → GPW

The user's stated next-steps, with the dependency structure made explicit. **GPW (§2.4) is the payoff and the
forcing function for divergences (A)+(D).** The symmetry work (§2.1–2.2) is valuable in its own right and
partially independent of GPW.

```

### 2.1 Symmorphic space groups (foundation)
Extend `qcSymmetry` (which already has molecular point groups + `Lattice_3D`/Bloch machinery — note a qcSymmetry
folder/namespace reorg into `Atom`/`Molecule`/`Lattice_3D` recently landed) with **symmorphic** space groups =
point group ⋉ lattice translations (no screw axes / glide planes). New pieces: the space-group operations
(point op + lattice translation), the **star of k**, the **little co-group** of k, and its small (irreducible)
representations. *Symmorphic-first is the right scoping:* the little group's reps are just ordinary point-group
reps — **no fractional-translation phase / ray (projective) representations**, which is exactly the complexity
that non-symmorphic groups add. Defer non-symmorphic to a later round.

### 2.2a Brillouin-zone reduction (irreducible wedge) — *independent of SALC*
Use the symmorphic space group to fold the k-point mesh to the **irreducible Brillouin zone** and carry per-k
weights, so a periodic SCF only diagonalizes symmetry-distinct k-points. This is the **most broadly useful**
symmetry payoff for solids (it cuts SCF cost directly) and needs only §2.1 — not SALC, not GPW. Clean correctness
check: total energy from the reduced+weighted mesh equals the full-mesh energy.

### 2.2b SALC with plane waves — *independent of GPW*
Symmetry-adapt the `{G}` plane-wave basis: build symmetry-adapted combinations within each **star of G**, block-
diagonalizing the PW Hamiltonian. Mirrors the existing molecular SALC (`SymmetryAdapt`, `ShellRep`,
`OperationRep`) but on `{G}` instead of AO shells. Good, self-contained validation of §2.1 with a crisp check
(symmetry-blocked PW-SCF == unadapted PW-SCF). **Note:** GPW's *variational* basis is Gaussians (adapted by the
point group + Bloch), so SALC-PW is **not** a hard prerequisite for GPW — it's the cheaper way to exercise §2.1.

### 2.3 `PlaneWave_IBS` "bad habits" review — do before GPW
`PlaneWave_IBS` was coded early and accreted responsibilities that don't belong on a basis. Round 1 already
extracted **one** (fitting: "the basis should not do fits — `qcFitting` does, through a real independent fit basis
set," now honoured via `PlaneWaveFit_IBS` + the factory seam). GPW will lean hard on `PlaneWave_IBS` (it *is* the
reciprocal-space grid engine), so **audit it for the remaining cruft first** — a short, high-leverage cleanup
before building on top. Candidate smells to check (verify against current code — some may already be gone):
- SRP violations: does the basis still own things that are really term/Hamiltonian or fitting concerns
  (density→grid, ρ̃→Hartree/FFT-XC assembly currently kept concrete on it "for now")?
- `dynamic_cast`-reached capabilities that could be a clean abstract face (the CLAUDE.md cast policy).
- Anything assuming Γ-only or a single k where the lattice generalization needs the full k-set.
- Ownership/mesh/grid duplication now that the fitter owns its own grid.
- **✅ DONE — the `MakeFourierDensity(D)` density-matrix leak (was the headline SRP item for this review).**
  Fixed exactly as the molecular precedent: `Band_FT_IBS::MakeFourierDensity(const hmat_t<dcmplx>& D)` is gone;
  the basis now exposes only the **D-free** `GetFourierGather() → const FourierGather&` (a new `qcMath` type —
  the delta-sparse `{G}` 3-centre "integrals" `⟨G_i G_j|Δm⟩ = δ(Δm,G_i−G_j)/Ω`, one bucket per fit function
  `Δm`, lazily cached, the `ERI3` analogue), and `IrrepCD<dcmplx>::GetFourierDensity()` does the `D`-contraction
  via the templated `ContractFourierGather(gather, D)` (mirrors the finite `GetRepulsion3C`). `D` never crosses
  into `qcBasisSet` on either the real-space or reciprocal-space path now. Bit-identical (176/176 UTMain green,
  Silicon SCF anchors + the `Repulsion(MakeFourierDensity(D))` round-trip tests unchanged). *Original analysis,
  kept for the record:*
  `BasisSet::Band_FT_IBS::MakeFourierDensity(const hmat_t<dcmplx>& D)` — and its concrete override
  `PlaneWave_IBS::MakeFourierDensity(const chmat_t& D)` — took the **density matrix** `D` (a `ChargeDensity`
  concept) straight into the `BasisSet` interface; `IrrepCD<dcmplx>::GetFourierDensity()` reached the basis by
  `dynamic_cast<Band_FT_IBS*>` and handed it `itsDensityMatrix`. That was the plane-wave violation of exactly the
  two separations the **molecular** side already achieves, in **both** directions:
  1. **`D` must not leak into the basis.** The molecular DFT-assembly face `Band_DFT_IBS` takes *only* real-space
     `ScalarFunction`s — "the density IS one" — with deliberately **NO getters**; the density matrix never
     crosses into `qcBasisSet`. `Band_FT_IBS` should likewise never see `D`.
  2. **The basis functions must not leak into the density.** The charge density holds a pointer to its orbital
     basis (`IrrepCD<T>::itsBasisSet`, an `Orbital_1E_IBS<T>*`) and asks it exactly two questions — it never grabs
     the raw `{φᵢ}` to hold: **(1)** `φ(r)` as a `VectorFunction` (`(*itsBasisSet)(r)`) to implement `rho.op(r) =
     Σφᵢ Dᵢⱼ φⱼ`; or **(2)** the fit **projection** — cast to `Orbital_DFT_IBS` and call `Repulsion3C(D, fbs)`.
     The reciprocal-space neutral bridge already exists and is the exact analogue of the fit projection: the
     **rho-tilde `ΔG_Map`** — `Fitting::ProjectedDensity_G` already wraps it as the neutral fitter argument and
     `Band_FT_IBS::Repulsion(const ΔG_Map&)` already consumes it cleanly. So it is **only the `D → rho-tilde`
     PRODUCTION** that is misplaced (a basis method that swallows `D`).
  - **The precise fix — mirror molecular's D-free `MakeRepulsion3C` + density-side contraction (option (2) for `{G}`).**
    Molecular's fit projection `⟨ρ|c⟩ = Σ_ab D_ab⟨ab|c⟩` keeps `D` **entirely out of `qcBasisSet`**: the basis
    implements only the **abstract, D-free** `MakeRepulsion3C(c) → ERI3<T>` (the cached 3-centre integral TENSOR
    `⟨ab|c⟩`, keyed by `BasisSetID`, built once) and exposes it via `Repulsion3C(c) → const ERI3&`; the
    `D`-contraction lives on the **charge density**, which owns `D`
    ([IrrepCD::GetRepulsion3C](../src/ChargeDensity/Internal/Imp/IrrepCD.C): `for i: ret[i]=blazem::sum(D % R[i])`).
    (This was cleaned up as the setup for this item — the old `Orbital_DFT_IBS::Repulsion3C(D,c)`/`Overlap3C(D,c)`
    convenience overloads, which had let `D` cross into the basis, were deleted; 176/176 bit-identical.) The
    plane-wave 3-centre integral is just
    the delta `⟨ij|c⟩ = (1/√Ω)·δ(G_c, Gᵢ−Gⱼ)`, so `Σ_ij D_ij⟨ij|Δm⟩ = (1/Ω)Σ_{Gᵢ−Gⱼ=Δm}D_ij` — *is* today's
    `MakeFourierDensity(D)`. It only needs the **same two-way split**: (a) a D-free abstract primitive the concrete
    PW/fit basis implements = the `{G}`-difference gather structure (the delta's support; mirror of
    `MakeRepulsion3C(c)`), and (b) a generic `D`-contraction helper (mirror of `Repulsion3C(D,c)`), driven by the
    `FourierDensity`, which then exposes `rho-tilde` as its face. Net: the concrete φ-owning plane-wave code never
    sees `D`, and rho-tilde is produced by the *same* "contract `D` against cached 3-centre integrals" pattern as
    molecular. (The delta makes the integrals trivial/uncached — but the *interface* is what we're separating.)
  - **Keep** the *other* overload `MakeFourierDensity(const Structure*, formFactor)` — it takes a structure + form
    factor (no `D`), is the density-analogue of `MakeLocalPotential` (the SAD seed), and does not leak.
Output: a ranked list + the cheap ones done, mirroring the Round-1 fitting extraction.

### 2.4 GPW (Gaussian And Plane Waves) — the payoff
**Method (CP2K / Lippert–Hutter):** orbitals in Gaussians (compact, good for core/valence); represent the
electron **density on a regular real-space grid**; FFT to G-space and solve Poisson there for Hartree
(`V_H(G) = 4π ρ(G)/G²`); evaluate XC on the grid; integrate the grid potential back against the Gaussians to form
the KS matrix. This is precisely where molecular and lattice PP **become one code path**:
- The KS matrix element `∫ φ_i V_grid φ_j` **is** `PP_Local`'s `qcMesh::WeightedOverlap(mesh, basis, V)` pattern
  generalized to an arbitrary grid potential `V` — resolving divergence (A).
- Running that on a `UnitCell` with periodic Gaussians is divergence (D).

**What we already have that GPW reuses:** the uniform `UnitCell` real-space mesh; `qchem.FFT`; the reciprocal-space
Poisson/Hartree machinery in `PW_Hartree` (and the Γ PW fit basis + factory seam from Round 1); geometry-neutral
PP terms; `Vnn`→Ewald on a `UnitCell`. **What's genuinely new:** (1) periodic Gaussian two-centre integrals
(Bloch/lattice sums), (2) the **collocate/integrate** pair (Gaussian density-matrix → grid ρ, and grid V → KS
matrix) — CP2K's "collocation", (3) the facade/`Structure` carrying the `UnitCell` through SCF (§1.D.2), (4)
deciding how GPW's grid-sourced Hartree relates to the existing PW density-fit path (they should share the
FFT-Poisson core, differing only in where ρ comes from). This last point connects to the **future denser-{G} fit
grid** already parked in Round 1 (§6.4/§7 there): GPW's density cutoff is the natural place that lands.

## 3. Recommended sequencing

1. **Cheap harmonizations, opportunistically now or as a warm-up:** (C) `IonIon<T>` — **DONE (GPW prep work 1)**,
   see (C) above. (B) does *not* fold into it (it's a PP-term concern → (D)); it stays in `PW_Pseudo` for now.
   Self-contained, low-risk, shrank the divergence surface.
2. **`PlaneWave_IBS` bad-habits review (§2.3).** Short, and it de-risks everything after.
3. **Symmorphic space groups (§2.1)**, then **BZ reduction (§2.2a)** as the first, highest-value, GPW-independent
   payoff (validates §2.1 and directly speeds solid SCF). **SALC-PW (§2.2b)** can follow or run in parallel as a
   second validation — not on the GPW critical path.
4. **Facade-preserves-`UnitCell` (§1.D.2)** — small, do it just before / as the first step of GPW.
5. **GPW (§2.4).** The body of the work; it collapses (A) and (D) and is the real target for solids/batteries.

(A) is intentionally *not* a standalone task — it dissolves under GPW. Don't write a molecular
`Integrals_Pseudo<double>`.

---

## 4. Invariants / pins to preserve (carry these into the work)

- **Never assume `orbital == fit`.** Any fit/aux basis is obtained from the orbital basis via
  `Create{CD,Vxc}FitBasisSet(...)` — the factory is the seam even when the answer is trivial (Round 1 §3.1).
- **Fit quality is measured by grid-convergence of ρ, NEVER by ΔE_total** (the fit is non-variational).
- **Spin-polarized is the native formulation**; unpolarized is the ζ=0 collapse. New GPW/periodic terms are
  spin-native from the start (`FittedVxcPol`/`FittedVcorrPol`), unpolarized as the efficiency corner.
- **The principled divergence stays:** real-space `V(r)` (molecular/GPW real-space terms) vs reciprocal `ṽ(G²)`
  (pure PW) is physics, not a wart. Pure plane waves keep `Integrals_Pseudo<dcmplx>` + their intrinsic G-grid.
- **Use well-conditioned bases for any SCF** (Slater/High for atoms; a cleanly-converted GTH valence basis for
  molecular PP) — the "LASolver" symptom is basis conditioning, not a solver gap. `N3`/`N5` are test-only pools,
  invalid for SCF.
- **Regression style:** periodic/GPW energies are "did-E-move" anchors (pin the converged value, no `Converged()`
  guard). Where a real-space-on-lattice quantity must equal its finite counterpart, assert bit-identity
  (`L_PP`-style) rather than an absolute oracle.
