Priority 1:
    -BasisGroup is not an interface.
    -BasisGroup needs a dynamic cast iterator.
    -BasisSet should really be IrrepBasisSet, and BasisGroup should really be BasisSet.
    -Until we get point group symmetry working, polarized Gaussians only have one IrrepBasisSet
    -HeapDB needs to be for whole basis set not just one irep.
    -Make sure BasisSet->DB->IE is enforced
        This means it takes a BasisSet argument for every call.
    -Clean up all the insert nonsense for DB, IE and BS
    -Cache reports
    -Stop caching RNLM inside GaussianCD
    -CDcache into its own source files.
    -Do we need to store both J and K,  PolG just stores one ERI4.
    -Fix valgrind errors
    -Use enum Types2C {Overlap2C, Repulsion2C,Kinetic,Nuclear} between DB and IE
    -Use one set of enums for Types2C {Overlap2C, Repulsion2C,Kinetic,Nuclear}



    -kT Occ smearing fails miserably.
    -LAParams for InverseOverlap are hard coded right now.  Need to re-org all basis set
     constructors with 3 versions
        1) HF orbitals needs LAPArams for secular eq.
        2) DFT orbitals needs LAPArams for secular eq. and separate set for inversion.
        3) DFT Vee, Vxc fitting, needs mesh and no LAParams.
      We will need a null Ortho type for LAParams for assertions.
      
Priority 2:
    -SMAT does not support S+=Xpr
    -Hunt for dynamic casts that can be removed using dynamic_cast iterator
    -Do something about the oml/imp includes.
        Done: -Stop deriving from StreamableObject  it is mostly static any way
        -Include binio in stream.h?
        -Move stream up from imp.
    -Persistent base doesn't do anything.
    -PolarizedGaussianBS use std::set for std::vector<std::vector<int> >    Ls;
        
    
Priority 3:
    -Support V*S without including matrix.h
    -typedefs for std::vector<Polarization>, std::vector<SMat>, List<RVec3>
    -Lattice unit tests?
    -template <class T> T Max(const std::vector<T>& v) in one place
    -Get rid of 
        TwoLPlusOne
    -Mesh code re-write  use pairs of points/weights, also get rid of
        MeshBrowser 
        AngularMeshBrowser 
        RadialMeshBrowser 
    -LOts of one off indexing between ptr_vector and Vector: Support Vector[i] for zero based indexing?
    -If N_nucleus=1 (atom) leave out Vnn term.
    -Get rid of HeapDB<T>::operator==(const IntegralDataBase<T>& idb) const
    -Support SMatrix for Lapack solvers.
        Lapack uses the extra space in the full matrix as working space.
        So we end up converting to full anyway.  THis is just a convenience for the user.
     ??? the order of H, which may cause some problem in the qchem code.
    -SphericalGuassian accept different exponent ranges for each L.
    -Dynamically adjust kT ?
    
    -Design problem:  
        IrrepWaveFunction creates and hold an rc_ptr<const BasisSet> which is also copied into
        the Ortbitals object.  Updateing the orbital is done by:
        TBasisSetImplementation<T>::CreateOrbitals.  But this function cannot just use this to create
        new orbitals, it needs the original rc_ptr.  Options:
        1) IrrepWaveFunction does and extra step to inject the rc_ptr.
            This means Orbital needs and Inject(rc_ptr<>) function.
            
    -Design question:
        Who should own the Hamitonian ... right now SCFIterator is deleting it.
    -Organize headers in the include folder.
    
            
            -These can be prided by an IEEngineClient base interface?  
        -Create Integrals folders for headers and code.
        
    -QuantumNumber.C

    Done: -It seems we need a separate HeapDN for each basis set.  Make something more general

                -cache Charge distributions
                -cache RNML tables
    Done: -Instancing in one file: 
        IntegralEngine.C
        IntegralDataBase.C
    Done: -DFT stop using InverseOverlap ... use SVD solver or something more stable.
        Done: HeapDB is doing the inversion.  It has no business doing this.  Should be 
        moved to IE.  But HeapDB caches the overlap.
