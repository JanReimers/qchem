            -Need to make a python binding using
                1) SIP https://github.com/Python-SIP/sip

                2) https://github.com/pybind/pybind11
                -Python bindings might be of interest anyway.
        -Matplot++ just does popup windows, hard to embbed ... which seems bizzare.
        -Gtkmm-PLplot https://tschoonj.github.io/gtkmm-plplot/index.html
            Looks primising,  workinside a GTK-C++ (gtkmm) app
            https://www.gtk.org/docs/language-bindings/cpp/
            Need to worry about GTK3 or GTK4 support
            GTK 2,3,4 comes with ubuntu linux
            -no windows support
            -Use GLADE to generate UI code.
        -Gnuplot has a c++ interface.

    -Set up IE_Primatives interface for each basis set radial type.
        Use an IE_Primatives* at the AtomIE level for all integrals.
        Then move more basis set code down to the AtomIE level.
        How to make this work with something like BSpline basis which does not use
            exponential/exponents?
            - IE_Primatives should mostly calculate tables of integrals S_ab, T_ab, V_ab.
            - Is this just the old IE interface re-appearing?

        Yes
        Done: -But need to check that exchange integrals work out properly when spin is folded

        into the Irrep blocking system.

        -There are three concepts here:
            1) principle QN: n
            2) symmetry: Yl, Ylm, Point group
            3) spin.
            -For relativistic calculations the spherical spinor combines Ylm and spin.
             but I think we can still separate out spin.
        -Basis sets can be characterized by the symmetry part, but no by n,ms
        -Orbitals are of course characterized by all four QNs for polarized calculations
            and by n,sym for un polarized calculations.
            Orbitals should have a Spin.
        -We only need polymorphism for #2.
        -Need < op for std::maps<>
            This requires a hash value. (((n-1)*Nmax+l)*lmax+(ml+l))*lmax+(ms+0.5)
        -Need op== and MatchType(IQNs_a,IQNs_b)
        -Store j,mj,ms=n/2 QNs as double or some sort of frac class?
        -Plan:
            -QuantumNumber -> QNs for brevity and plurality
            -Make a IrrepSymmetry interface for Yl, Ylm, Omega_kappa
            -Make an OrbitalQNs class for {IrrepSymmetry,n,ms}
            -Use OrbitalQNs->ms() instead of Spin s in WF,CD etc.
            -Git rid of PolarizedCD
            -Get rid of PolarizedWF.
        -I think we need the following associations:
            -Orbital_IBS has Symmetry = {l,ml} or {kappa} or {chi}
            -IrrepOrbitals has IrrepQNs = {ms,Symmetry}
            -Orbital has Orbital_QNs = {n,ms,Symmetry}
            -Could do IrrepQNs is just and Orbital_QNs with n=0.  But it would be better to
             use the type system to distinguish.
            -Are these related by containment or inheritance?
                Symmetry is polymorphic whihc suggest containment
                Irrep_QNs is not and Orbital_QNs, so again containment.
        -Do we still need AngularQN and AtomQN?
        -Need a more elegent version of

    -Rethink WaveFunctions
        -WaveFunctionGroup should have

            map<QN,IrrepWaveFunction*> Dn //QNs are all spin dn
            What about un-polarized?  ust use All list?
            But what is QN?  
                QuantumNumber* ?  NO  QNs can get cloned.
            -Use unordered_map and overload op==(const QuantumNumber*, const QuantumNumber*);

        -It can have a separate DB since no 4C integrals are required.

    -Do we need to store both J and K,  PolG just stores one ERI4.
        With separate Vee and Vxc it seems we need to store J and K separatly.
        We could just store JK=J-0.5*K to save space, but then we need a combined Ham term.
        How doe PolG do it with just J?

        Done: Do Angular integrals in blocks.
        Steps
        Done: 1) Separate sums for J K
            for J do
                loop ab
                Ak(l_ab,m_ab), Rk(l_ab,e_ab)
                  loop cd
                  Ak(l_cd,m_cd), Rk(l_cd,e_cd)
                    J=sum(k,Ak(ab)*Ak(cd)*{Rk(ab)+Rk(cd)+})
        No: 2) Can we cache Ak(ab), Rk(ab) ?  (instead of blocking)
            Blocking should be more efficient, less map<> lookups.
        Done: Shareable 4way cache.
    Done: -Fix Boron.
        The K integrals appear correct, at least for s & p orbitals in Boron.
        So why does PG work and SL fails?
        Because the in the PG basis occupied Px can split from py/pz, and give a small energy gain.
        For SL it is hard coded as one level with degen=2L+1=3.
        We would need to introduce the m QN number and allow m splitting, at least for valance shells.
    -Slater_m next steps now that Boron is working:
        Done: 1) Clean up data dumps.
        Done: 2) Get all UTas running again.
        Done: 3) Refactor out the angular parts with all the w3j symbols
        Done: 4) Build static wj3 tables using the wigner library.
        Done: 5) Get d orbitals working
        6) Try Sc again.
            Still difficult.  PG nails it.  Need to sort out all the factors of 4*Pi.
            No: 10) Get 4Pi^2 out of the integral engines.  Why?
            -Better to completely dis-entangle angular and radial.
            -Evaluate angular for whole blocks.  Less w3j lookups.
        Done: 7) Make a SG_m basis set.
            Done: We could optionally read the exponents and contractions from the BS files.
        Done: 8) 3C repulsions should call R_k(lalblcld) directly.
        Done: 9) Stop building zero density matrices.   And definitely don''t bother contracting them!!!
        11) Check for double calculation of J/K ERIs
    Done: -Survey Z=2-25
        Fixed: Big trouble starts at Sc.
    Done: -Attack Sc problem:
        1) Review angular integral theory
        2) Build PolGau BS with only primitives to match SGm exponents.  Look at J/K tables.
        3) Use libcint for Real-spheric GTOs and check against SGm.
            https://orbkit.github.io/dev/integrals/libcint.html
            https://github.com/ValeevGroup/libintx
        4) Done: Check high Z closed shell atoms.  If these are correct the d/f ERI integrals must be right .. No?
            SGm/SLm unpolarized *OR* polarized  all get Sr/Ba (38/56) wrong  d^2 instead of s^2 in the valance shell.
            options:
            4.1) Simulated anneal occupations with Fermi function.
            4.2) Electron dumper force s valance electrons
                For Sc we need to force 4s^2 (E=-0.21) or 3d^1 (E=-0.34) ... or both?
                
            4.3) Read in an accurate starting charge density.  (this could get complicated fast)
        
    Done: -Mesh code re-write  use pairs of points/weights, also get rid of

            1) eval BasisSet(r), loop over rs
            2) Integrate with weights, loop over ws.
            -Is better to just do a weighted eval with one loop?
                The weighted eval should then use the sqrt(W).
                Not always sqrt(W)!!!  i.e. charge integral.
        -use size() in VectorFunction<T>
            Got into a big mess with final overrider.
        Done: No -Do we really need separate Eval, and EvalGrad functions?

        Use std:: for Cluster pointers.
    Done: -Fix all warnings.
    Done: -Get rid of TwoLPlusOne
    Done -Do we still nee fast contraction functions?
    Done: -Design problem:  
        IrrepWaveFunction creates and hold an rc_ptr<const BasisSet> which is also copied into
        the Ortbitals object.  Updateing the orbital is done by:
        TIrrepBasisSetCommon<T>::CreateOrbitals.  But this function cannot just use this to create
        new orbitals, it needs the original rc_ptr.  Options:
        1) IrrepWaveFunction does and extra step to inject the rc_ptr.
            This means Orbital needs and Inject(rc_ptr<>) function.
    Done -LAParams for InverseOverlap are hard coded right now.  Need to re-org all basis set
     constructors with 3 versions
        1) HF orbitals needs LAPArams for secular eq.
        2) DFT orbitals needs LAPArams for secular eq. and separate set for inversion.
        3) DFT Vee, Vxc fitting, needs mesh and no LAParams.
